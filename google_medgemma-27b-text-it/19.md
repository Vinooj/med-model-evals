Yes, absolutely! There are several non-traditional radiation therapy (RT) approaches being investigated or even implemented clinically for their potential to improve tumor control while minimizing toxicity, which can indirectly address or potentially overcome some aspects of radioresistance. Here's a breakdown of some key examples:

**1. Spatially Fractionated Radiotherapy (SFRT):**

*   **Concept:** Instead of delivering the entire prescribed dose uniformly across the target volume, SFRT divides the total dose into multiple smaller beams ("microbeams") separated by irradiated tissue regions. This creates a pattern where only a small fraction of the normal tissue receives a high dose at any given time.
*   **Mechanism & Resistance Relevance:** The idea is that this spatial fractionation spares healthy tissues from excessive damage while still allowing the tumor cells to receive sufficient cumulative dose over time. It might also exploit differences in repair capacity between tumors and normal tissues under these specific conditions. Some studies suggest it could enhance the abscopal effect (where local treatment triggers systemic anti-tumor immunity). While not directly targeting intrinsic resistance mechanisms like DNA repair defects, it aims to deliver effective doses *despite* potential resistance by altering the delivery paradigm. Examples include Grid Therapy and Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT).

**2. Pulsed Reduced Dose Rate (PRDRT) / Hyperfractionation Variants:**

*   **Concept:** Delivering the daily fraction dose using very short pulses interspersed with longer periods of no irradiation. Alternatively, hyperfractionation involves giving more fractions per day but reducing the size of each fraction.
*   **Mechanism & Resistance Relevance:** These schedules aim to increase the biological effectiveness ratio (BER), meaning they cause relatively more damage to rapidly proliferating tumor cells compared to slowly dividing normal tissues. They may deplete oxygen levels within the tumor during the pulse intervals, making the tumor more sensitive during subsequent pulses (exploiting the Oxygen Enhancement Ratio - OER). By increasing the relative impact on tumor vs. normal tissue, PRDRT attempts to achieve better therapeutic outcomes even when facing moderate radioresistance.

**3. Flash Radiation Therapy (Flash RT):**

*   **Concept:** Delivering the entire prescribed dose extremely quickly – typically in less than 100 milliseconds (often around 50 ms). This requires specialized accelerators capable of producing ultra-high instantaneous dose rates.
*   **Mechanism & Resistance Relevance:** Flash RT has shown remarkable pre-clinical results demonstrating significantly improved sparing of normal tissues compared to conventional RT, while maintaining or even enhancing tumor cell killing. The exact biophysical mechanism isn
