**Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) exhibit distinct mutation patterns that reflect their unique biological characteristics and clinical behaviors** , though some alterations overlap across histological subtypes.

## Invasive Lobular Carcinoma vs. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma

**CDH1 mutations are the defining genetic hallmark of ILC** , occurring in approximately 56% of cases compared to only 6% in IDC.[1]

Among ILC cases with wild-type CDH1 (44%), 90% demonstrate low CDH1 expression through alternative mechanisms including promoter methylation or gene fusions.[2][3]

CDH1 truncating mutations correlate with radiohistologic size discordance and represent an independent poor prognosis factor for metastasis risk and breast cancer-related mortality.[4] **PIK3CA mutations are significantly enriched in ILC** across molecular subtypes. In HR+/HER2- disease, PIK3CA mutations occur in 37.9% of metastatic ILC versus 27.0% of metastatic IDC (p[1]

This enrichment persists in triple-negative disease (23.8% vs 12.8%).[1]

ILC demonstrates the highest AKT phosphorylation among all breast cancer subtypes, consistent with PI3K pathway activation.[2]

Additional ILC-enriched mutations include **PTEN, TBX3, FOXA1, and NF1** .[2][5]

NF1 variants occur in 6.6% of HR+/HER2- ILC versus 3.0% of IDC.[1] **TP53 mutations are more prevalent in IDC than ILC** across subtypes. In HR+/HER2- disease, TP53 mutations occur in 21.9% of IDC versus 13.9% of ILC; in triple-negative disease, the difference is even more pronounced (51.0% vs 4.8%).[1] **GATA3 mutations characterize luminal A IDC** (3.7% vs 0.3% in ILC), suggesting differential modulation of ER activity between histotypes.[1][2] **FGFR amplifications** are more frequent in IDC (5.9% vs 2.8% in ILC), while paradoxically,[1] **ERBB2 variants are more common in ILC** (6.2% vs 2.5%), despite HER2 protein overexpression being less frequent in ILC.[1]

At the transcriptional level, ILC demonstrates **higher expression of TFAP2B, SOCS2, NOSTRIN, THBS4, SCUBE2, and GDF9** , while IDC shows elevated **CDCA4, PSMG1, LMOD1, and SLC7A5** .[3]

ILC tumors are less genomically rearranged and heterogeneous than IDC, with distinct copy number alteration patterns.[6]

Two main ILC subtypes exist: (1) an immune-related subtype with upregulation of PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA-4 (44% of cases), and (2) a hormone-related subtype associated with EMT and specific chromosomal gains/losses.[7]

## Inflammatory Breast Cancer

**IBC demonstrates a distinct genomic landscape characterized by exceptionally high TP53 mutation rates** (72% overall), significantly enriched compared to non-IBC even after adjusting for molecular subtype and stage.[8][9]

In HER2+ disease specifically, TP53 mutations show particular enrichment in IBC.[8] **ERBB2 alterations occur in 32% of IBC cases** , with overexpression twice as frequent in IBC compared to non- inflammatory tumors (independent of molecular subtype).[8][10]

Additional frequent alterations include **PIK3CA (24%), CCND1 (12%), MYC (9%), FGFR1 (8%), and GATA3 (8%)** .[8] **NOTCH pathway alterations are enriched in IBC** , particularly in HER2+ disease.[8][9]

DNA repair pathway genes, including **BRCA2 (14%)** , are more frequently altered in IBC than non-IBC.[8][9]

The tumor mutational burden is higher in IBC compared to non-IBC.[8][9]

Ninety-seven percent of IBCs display at least one actionable genetic alteration, higher than the 87% observed in non-IBC.[9]

Pathways more frequently altered in IBC include DNA repair, NOTCH signaling, and CDK4/6.[9] **TP53, CCND1, and RB1 alterations associate with poor outcomes in IBC** .[8]

## Overlapping Features Despite histological differences,

**molecular subtype (ER/PR/HER2 status) remains a dominant determinant of mutation patterns** . For example, TP53 mutations are enriched in triple-negative disease regardless of histology, while PIK3CA mutations predominate in HR+ tumors across histotypes.[1][11]

Mixed ductal-lobular carcinomas demonstrate spatial heterogeneity with distinct intrinsic subtypes in different regions (e.g., triple-negative ductal and ER+ luminal lobular components within the same tumor), highlighting that molecular classification can transcend histological boundaries.[12]

The genomic landscape reveals that breast tumors fall along a continuum constrained by three genomic archetypes: (1) ER+ high-risk with complex focal amplifications, (2) HER2+ with similar complex rearrangements, and (3) triple-negative with genome-wide instability.[13]

These archetypes are established early during tumorigenesis and are conserved in metastatic disease.[13]

Would you like me to summarize the latest evidence on how these distinct mutation patterns influence therapeutic decision-making and response to targeted therapies across the different histological subtypes of breast cancer?
