**Mutations Leading to Resistance to Both Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy:**

Several genetic alterations can confer resistance to *both* chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT). This often happens because the underlying mechanisms involved in DNA damage repair or cell death pathways are targeted by both treatment modalities. Here's a breakdown of key examples:

1.  **DNA Damage Repair Pathway Mutations:**
    *   **BRCA1/2 Germline Mutations:** These are well-known for conferring sensitivity to certain chemotherapies like platinum agents (cisplatin, carboplatin) and PARP inhibitors. However, paradoxically, they can also be associated with some degree of intrinsic resistance to RT in certain contexts (e.g., breast cancer), potentially due to impaired homologous recombination repair which is crucial after radiation-induced double-strand breaks. The relationship is complex and context-dependent. Loss of BRCA function impairs HR, leading to accumulation of DSBs. While this makes cells sensitive to drugs targeting HR (like PARPi), it might make them less responsive to RT in some cases as the primary mechanism of killing (HR failure) is already compromised. Conversely, loss of BRCA can sensitize tumors to RT by impairing NHEJ backup pathway. Overall effect depends on tumor type and specific therapy regimen.
    *   **ATM Gene Mutations:** ATM plays a central role in detecting and signaling DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by both CT (especially platinum agents) and RT. Inactivating mutations in ATM can reduce the cellular response to these therapies. Cells lacking functional ATM may fail to activate downstream checkpoints and repair pathways effectively, leading to reduced apoptosis upon DNA damage. This results in increased survival despite exposure to damaging treatments.
    *   **CHK2 Gene Mutations:** CHK2 is another kinase activated by ATM following DSB detection. It acts further downstream in the checkpoint activation cascade. Mutations inactivating CHK2 can similarly blunt the response to DNA damaging agents used in CT and RT.
    *   **RAD51 Mutations/Alterations:** RAD51 is essential for Homologous Recombination (HR), a major pathway for repairing DSBs induced by CT and RT. Alterations affecting RAD51 expression or function can impact the effectiveness of both treatments. For example, overexpression or copy number gains of RAD51 have been linked to chemoresistance and radioresistance in various cancers.
    *   **Other DDR Genes:** Mutations in genes involved in other DNA repair pathways like Base Excision Repair (BER - e.
