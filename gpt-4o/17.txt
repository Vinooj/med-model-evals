Overcoming drug resistance, particularly in cancer and infectious diseases, is a significant focus of current medical research. Several therapeutic strategies and experimental drugs are under investigation to address this challenge:

1. **Targeted Therapies**: These involve drugs designed to target specific genetic mutations or pathways that contribute to resistance. For example, in cancer, next-generation inhibitors are being developed to target mutations that confer resistance to first-line treatments.

2. **Combination Therapies**: Using multiple drugs simultaneously can help prevent or overcome resistance. This approach is common in cancer treatment and HIV therapy, where combining drugs with different mechanisms of action can reduce the likelihood of resistance developing.

3. **Immunotherapy**: This includes treatments that harness the body's immune system to fight disease. In cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapies are being explored to overcome resistance to traditional therapies.

4. **Epigenetic Modulators**: These drugs aim to modify the expression of genes involved in resistance without altering the genetic code itself. By changing the epigenetic landscape, these therapies can potentially reverse resistance mechanisms.

5. **Nanotechnology-Based Approaches**: Nanoparticles can be used to deliver drugs more effectively to target cells, potentially overcoming mechanisms of drug efflux or poor drug penetration that contribute to resistance.

6. **Gene Editing Technologies**: Techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 are being investigated to directly modify or correct genetic mutations that lead to resistance.

7. **Novel Antimicrobials and Antibiotics**: In the field of infectious diseases, new classes of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents are being developed to combat resistant strains of bacteria and viruses.

Several experimental drugs and therapies are currently in various stages of clinical investigation:

- **Cancer**: Numerous clinical trials are underway testing new targeted therapies, combination regimens, and immunotherapies for resistant cancers. For example, trials are exploring the use of bispecific antibodies and next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

- **Infectious Diseases**: New antibiotics and antiviral agents are being tested in clinical trials to address resistance in pathogens like MRSA, tuberculosis, and HIV.

- **Gene Therapy**: Trials are exploring the use of gene editing to correct mutations responsible for resistance in certain genetic disorders.

These efforts are part of a broader strategy to develop more effective treatments for resistant diseases, with many promising candidates in the pipeline. For the most current information, consulting clinical trial registries and recent publications in medical journals is recommended.
