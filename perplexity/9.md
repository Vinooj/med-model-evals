# Is there a correlation between radionomics and resistance patterns?  Is there literature that demonstrates a consistent and statistically significant correlation between radinomics and resistance mechanisms?

Radiomics features do show correlations with some resistance‑related phenotypes, but evidence that they consistently and robustly track specific molecular resistance mechanisms is still emerging and not yet definitive. Existing studies are promising but mostly single‑center, modest in size, and require external validation before being considered clinically established.

## What has been shown so far

- MRI‑based radiomics signatures have been developed to predict endocrine resistance risk in hormone‑receptor‑positive, non‑metastatic breast cancer, with models achieving statistically significant discrimination between patients who did and did not develop endocrine therapy resistance.[^3][^6]
- Radiomics features from multiparametric MRI have been correlated with genomic characteristics and receptor status (e.g., HER2 expression, proliferation markers), providing an imaging surrogate for some molecular profiles that themselves are linked to resistance risk.[^4][^7]


## Correlation with resistance mechanisms

- Radiomics–genomics (“radiogenomics”) studies in breast cancer report associations between MR radiomics clusters and underlying transcriptomic or genomic signatures, including proliferation, immune and stromal pathways, and intrinsic subtypes that influence therapy response and resistance patterns.[^5][^4]
- Some radiomics signatures associated with endocrine resistance appear to reflect more aggressive biology (higher proliferation, lower hormone dependence) rather than directly encoding a specific mutation such as ESR1, PIK3CA, or BRCA; in other words, they correlate with resistance‑prone phenotypes more than with discrete resistance mutations.[^3][^4]


## How consistent and statistically strong is the evidence?

- Across published work, many models report statistically significant associations (AUCs typically in the 0.7–0.8 range) between pre‑treatment radiomics features and outcomes such as endocrine failure or recurrence, indicating non‑trivial predictive signal.[^6][^3]
- However, most studies are retrospective, use limited cohorts, and often lack multi‑institutional external validation; performance can drop when tested on independent datasets, highlighting concerns about reproducibility and generalizability.[^4][^5]


## Current limitations and gaps

- There is not yet a widely accepted, clinically validated radiomics signature that maps directly and reliably onto specific resistance mechanisms (e.g., HR‑repair restoration, ESR1 mutation, PI3K pathway activation) in breast cancer.
- Radiomics features are high‑dimensional and affected by acquisition parameters, reconstruction, and segmentation; without robust standardization and large multicenter validation, associations with resistance mechanisms may be unstable across sites and scanners.


## Practical interpretation

- At present, radiomics is best viewed as a complementary tool that can non‑invasively capture aspects of tumor heterogeneity and biology that correlate with risk of treatment failure or aggressive/resistant phenotypes.
- The literature does support statistically significant correlations between certain radiomics signatures and resistance‑related outcomes (especially endocrine resistance), but it does **not** yet establish a consistent, mechanistically specific link between radiomics patterns and defined molecular resistance mechanisms across cohorts.
