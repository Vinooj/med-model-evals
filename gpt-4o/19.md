Yes, there are several non-traditional radiation methods that have been explored to study resistance patterns and potentially overcome resistance in cancer treatment. These methods aim to enhance the therapeutic ratio by maximizing tumor control while minimizing damage to normal tissues. Here are a few notable techniques:

1. **Spatially Fractionated Radiotherapy (GRID Therapy):** This technique involves delivering radiation in a spatially fractionated manner, where high-dose radiation is delivered through a grid-like pattern, creating alternating high-dose and low-dose regions. This approach can help spare normal tissue while delivering a high dose to the tumor, potentially overcoming resistance by exploiting differential responses between tumor and normal tissues.

2. **Pulsed Reduced Dose Rate Radiotherapy (PRDR):** PRDR involves delivering radiation in a series of pulses at a reduced dose rate. This method allows for repair of normal tissue between pulses while maintaining the cumulative dose to the tumor. It has been investigated for its potential to re-sensitize tumors that have become resistant to conventional radiotherapy.

3. **FLASH Radiotherapy:** FLASH radiotherapy delivers ultra-high dose rates of radiation over a very short period, typically less than a second. This approach has shown promise in preclinical studies for reducing normal tissue toxicity while maintaining tumor control. The mechanism is thought to involve differential oxygen effects and other biological responses that are not yet fully understood.

4. **Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT):** MRT uses very narrow beams of radiation, typically in the micrometer range, to deliver high doses to the tumor while sparing surrounding normal tissue. This technique exploits the differential response of tissues to microbeam irradiation, potentially overcoming resistance by targeting tumor vasculature and enhancing immune responses.

5. **Proton and Heavy Ion Therapy:** While not entirely non-traditional, these modalities offer distinct physical and biological advantages over conventional photon therapy. The unique dose distribution and higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of protons and heavy ions can be leveraged to overcome radioresistance in certain tumor types.

These non-traditional methods are still largely in the research and experimental stages, with ongoing studies to better understand their mechanisms, optimize their delivery, and evaluate their efficacy and safety in clinical settings.
