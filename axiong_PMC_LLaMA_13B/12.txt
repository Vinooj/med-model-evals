The question is too broad as posed. However, if you want to look at it from an overall perspective, then yes, different mechanisms of drug resistance emerge over time when looking at first-line versus second- or third-line treatment for breast cancer. In general terms, de novo acquired resistance (i.e., developing resistance during the course of treatment) tends to be more complex than acquired resistance following sequential single agent treatments. This relates to issues such as non-overlapping spectrum of mechanisms with each successive line of therapy and also potential cross-resistance between certain classes of agents used in sequence.
