**Multiple therapeutic strategies are currently under development to overcome resistance in breast cancer, with numerous experimental agents in clinical trials targeting diverse resistance mechanisms across all breast cancer subtypes. ** ## Novel Endocrine Therapies for HR+/HER2- Disease **Next-generation selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs)** are being developed to overcome ESR1 mutation-mediated resistance. Imlunestrant, an oral SERD recently FDA-approved, demonstrated efficacy in ESR1-mutant disease following prior endocrine therapy. Additional oral SERDs are currently in phase III trials, with some specifically targeting patients with ESR1 mutations. **Estrogen receptor covalent antagonists, novel selective estrogen receptor modulators, and selective androgen receptor modulators** are also under investigation. **ER proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs)** represent an innovative approach to degrade the estrogen receptor entirely, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms that preserve partial ER function. ## Targeting Resistance Pathways **AKT inhibitors are now in several phase III trials** to overcome PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-mediated resistance. Capivasertib, recently FDA-approved in combination with fulvestrant for PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered disease, demonstrated significant benefit. Ipatasertib showed promising phase 2 results in the LOTUS trial for metastatic TNBC, though the IPATunity130 trial failed to confirm these findings in first-line treatment. The AKT inhibitors ipatasertib and uprosertib are undergoing clinical investigation specifically for TNBC. **Aurora kinase A inhibitors** are under active clinical development, targeting a common resistance node identified in CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant disease. **Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors** are being evaluated, particularly for tumors with FGFR1-3 fusions or mutations. Erdafitinib is classified as category 2B evidence for FGFR-altered breast cancer. **Combination strategies to prevent or delay CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance** are being tested in phase III trials. The IND.241 platform trial is evaluating lunresertib (PKMYT1 inhibitor) plus gemcitabine in patients with/without CCNE1 alterations, and lunresertib plus camonsertib (ATR inhibitor) for similar populations. Based on preclinical data showing synergy, combinations of CDK4/6 inhibitors with AKT inhibitors are under evaluation. **Continuing CDK4/6 inhibitors following progression**—either changing the inhibitor, the endocrine therapy, or both—is also being studied. ## Antibody-Drug Conjugates **Multiple novel ADCs are in advanced clinical development. ** Datopotamab deruxtecan (anti-TROP2 ADC) is FDA-approved for HR+/HER2- disease after prior endocrine and chemotherapy, though it did not meet the overall survival endpoint in TROPION-Breast01. It is now being tested in the postneoadjuvant setting (TROPION-Breast03 trial). **Sacituzumab tirumotecan** , another TROP2-targeted ADC superior to chemotherapy in metastatic disease, is being evaluated postneoadjuvantly in the MK-2870-012 phase 3 trial. For HER2+ disease, **trastuzumab deruxtecan is being compared to T-DM1 in the postneoadjuvant setting** (DESTINY-Breast05 trial) after demonstrating improved overall survival in metastatic disease. Sacituzumab govitecan is being tested for HER2-negative residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy in the OptimICE-RD and SASCIA trials. ## Overcoming PARP Inhibitor Resistance **DNA polymerase θ (POLθ) inhibitors** are under development to prevent BRCA reversion mutations, which account for 40-60% of PARP inhibitor resistance. Since 68% of reversions are mediated by microhomology- mediated end joining requiring POLθ, these inhibitors could maintain PARP sensitivity. **WEE1 inhibitors remain effective against revertant tumors** and represent another strategy. The IND.241 platform trial is evaluating **niraparib (PARP inhibitor) plus fulvestrant in patients with/without BRCA1/2 or PALB2 alterations** , testing whether this combination can overcome resistance in the CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant setting. ## Immunotherapy Combinations **Multiple strategies are being tested to enhance immunotherapy response and overcome resistance:** **Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies:** The PANACEA trial investigated trastuzumab plus pembrolizumab in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ disease, achieving 15.2% ORR in PD-L1- positive patients. Preclinical data show that CDK4/6 inhibitors stimulate interferon-γ signaling and enhance antigen presentation, with synergy demonstrated when combined with PD-1 blockade. A phase 1b study of pembrolizumab plus abemaciclib showed 14.3% ORR and 60% stable disease at 16 weeks. **PARP inhibitors combined with checkpoint blockade:** Clinical activity has been reported for olaparib plus durvalumab in germline BRCA-mutated metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer, and niraparib plus pembrolizumab in unselected metastatic TNBC. The TOPACIO trial combining niraparib plus pembrolizumab achieved 21% ORR in unselected TNBC, with higher rates in BRCA-variant (47%) and PD-L1-positive (32%) patients. **Postneoadjuvant immunotherapy escalation:** Pembrolizumab is being tested in the SWOG1418 phase 3 trial for patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. The PD-L1 inhibitors avelumab (A-Brave trial) and atezolizumab (Astefania trial) are also under investigation in this setting. ## Emerging Targeted Therapies **HER2-mutant disease (distinct from HER2-amplified):** Neratinib plus fulvestrant (category 2B) and neratinib plus trastuzumab plus fulvestrant (category 2A for ER+/HER2- patients post-CDK4/6 inhibitor) are recommended for HER2-activating mutations. These combinations showed promising results in the MutHER and SUMMIT trials. **Next-generation TRK inhibitors:** Repotrectinib is FDA-approved for NTRK fusion-positive tumors and may overcome resistance mutations that develop with first-generation TRK inhibitors like larotrectinib and entrectinib. **Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors:** Results of the entinostat E2112 trial are awaited, evaluating this epigenetic modulator in combination with endocrine therapy. ## Novel Therapeutic Approaches **Therapies inducing alternate forms of regulated cell death**—including ferroptosis and pyroptosis—are emerging approaches to overcome apoptosis resistance. **Photodynamic therapy and photothermal ablation combined with chemotherapy** are being investigated to overcome resistance. **Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems** are under development to co-deliver chemotherapeutic drugs with genes (siRNA and miRNA) that downregulate resistance-causing proteins like P-glycoprotein. **Chemosensitizers** that sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy effects are also being evaluated. **Metabolic modulators** targeting breast cancer stem cell metabolism represent another strategy, as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (dysregulated in nearly 60% of TNBC) plays a central role in chemoresistance through enhanced protein synthesis, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted DNA repair. ## Platform and Adaptive Trial Designs **The IND.241 Canadian Cancer Trials Group platform trial** represents an innovative approach, using liquid biopsy-informed biomarker stratification to evaluate multiple novel agents in CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. This master protocol design enables efficient evaluation of multiple substudies simultaneously while building a comprehensive tissue and data bank for biomarker discovery. Would you like me to summarize the most promising combination strategies currently in late-phase clinical trials that address multiple resistance mechanisms simultaneously, or discuss how circulating tumor DNA monitoring is being integrated into these trials to enable early detection of emerging resistance and adaptive treatment modifications? OpenEvidence matched 50+ active or recruiting clinical trials for breast cancer. Given the breadth of emerging therapies and ongoing trials, would you like me to focus on synthesizing the latest clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of AKT inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates in overcoming resistance in breast cancer, particularly highlighting any head-to-head comparisons or biomarker-driven subgroup analyses from recent phase III studies? This could help clarify which strategies are showing the most promise in real-world patient populations. 18.
