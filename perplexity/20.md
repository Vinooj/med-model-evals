# Can hyper- or hypo-fractionation alter resistance patterns as compared to conventionally fractionated radiation?

Yes, hyper- and hypo-fractionation can alter resistance patterns in breast cancer compared to conventional fractionation (1.8-2 Gy/fraction over 5-6 weeks), primarily by exploiting differences in tumor repopulation, DNA repair kinetics, and cancer stem cell (CSC) sensitivity, with hypofractionation often showing advantages against resistant phenotypes.[^1][^2][^5]

## Hypofractionation effects on resistance

Hypofractionation (e.g., 2.65-3.3 Gy/13-16 fractions or ultra-hypo like 5-6 Gy/5 fractions) reduces opportunities for resistant subclones to repopulate between fractions.

- Breast CSCs (CD44+/CD24low/ALDH1+), which drive radioresistance via enhanced DNA repair (NHEJ/HR) and survival signaling (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), exhibit lower α/β ratios (~4-10 Gy) than differentiated cells; hypofractionation preferentially kills them due to less repair time per dose, maintaining tumor control probability (TCP) even in CSC-rich tumors.[^2][^1]
- In models with high CSC fractions (e.g., TNBC lines like MDA-MB-231), hypo schemes require smaller dose escalations to match conventional TCP, unlike conventional fractionation where CSCs survive and expand.[^2]

Meta-analyses confirm equivalent oncologic outcomes (recurrence/survival) with moderate hypofractionation (MHF) vs conventional (CF), but improved cosmesis and acute toxicity, suggesting it mitigates resistance-linked fibrosis/EMT.[^5]

## Hyperfractionation effects

Hyperfractionation (e.g., 1.2 Gy twice daily) aims to escalate total dose while sparing late-responding normal tissue (α/β ~3 Gy).

- Accelerates treatment to limit repopulation in rapidly proliferating resistant tumors but risks enhanced repair in proficient DDR clones (e.g., BRCA-proficient post-PARPi); less studied in breast cancer, with data showing similar local control to CF but higher acute mucositis.[^9][^2]
- May select against hypoxic/resistant cores less effectively than hypo, as smaller doses allow reoxygenation but permit adaptive repair upregulation (e.g., FEN1, ATM).[^1]


## Key differences vs conventional fractionation

| Fractionation | Dose/Fx (Gy) | Resistance impact | Breast cancer evidence |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Conventional | 1.8-2 | Allows CSC repair/repopulation; higher late effects in resistant stroma | Standard post-lumpectomy; equivalent long-term control but more skin toxicity[^5] |
| Hypo (MHF/UHF) | 2.65-6 | Kills CSCs (low α/β); limits repopulation; immune priming | Non-inferior OS/DFS; better for CSC-high TNBC; UK START trials confirm[^2][^5] |
| Hyper | 1.1-1.2 (BID) | Reduces repopulation but risks DDR adaptation | Limited breast data; similar control, higher acute risks[^9] |

Hypofractionation emerges as optimal for overcoming intrinsic CSC/repair-mediated resistance, supported by trials like FAST-Forward (UHF non-inferior), while hyperfractionation suits select accelerated needs.[^5][^2]
