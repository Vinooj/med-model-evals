**Multiple therapeutic strategies are currently under development to overcome resistance in breast cancer, with numerous experimental agents in clinical trials targeting diverse resistance mechanisms across all breast cancer subtypes.**

## Novel Endocrine Therapies for HR+/HER2- Disease

**Next-generation selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs)** are being developed to overcome ESR1 mutation-mediated resistance. Imlunestrant, an oral SERD recently FDA-approved, demonstrated efficacy in ESR1-mutant disease following prior endocrine therapy. Additional oral SERDs are currently in phase III trials, with some specifically targeting patients with ESR1 mutations. **Estrogen receptor covalent antagonists, novel selective estrogen receptor modulators, and selective androgen receptor modulators** are also under investigation. **ER proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs)** represent an innovative approach to degrade the estrogen receptor entirely, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms that preserve partial ER function.

## Targeting Resistance Pathways

**AKT inhibitors are now in several phase III trials** to overcome PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-mediated resistance. Capivasertib, recently FDA-approved in combination with fulvestrant for PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered disease, demonstrated significant benefit. Ipatasertib showed promising phase 2 results in the LOTUS trial for metastatic TNBC, though the IPATunity130 trial failed to confirm these findings in first-line treatment. The AKT inhibitors ipatasertib and uprosertib are undergoing clinical investigation specifically for TNBC. **Aurora kinase A inhibitors** are under active clinical development, targeting a common resistance node identified in CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant disease. **Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors** are being evaluated, particularly for tumors with FGFR1-3 fusions or mutations. Erdafitinib is classified as category 2B evidence for FGFR-altered breast cancer. **Combination strategies to prevent or delay CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance** are being tested in phase III trials. The IND.241 platform trial is evaluating lunresertib (PKMYT1 inhibitor) plus gemcitabine in patients with/without CCNE1 alterations, and lunresertib plus camonsertib (ATR inhibitor) for similar populations. Based on preclinical data showing synergy, combinations of CDK4/6 inhibitors with AKT inhibitors are under evaluation. **Continuing CDK4/6 inhibitors following progression**—either changing the inhibitor, the endocrine therapy, or both—is also being studied.

## Antibody-Drug Conjugates

**Multiple novel ADCs are in advanced clinical development.** Datopotamab deruxtecan (anti-TROP2 ADC) is FDA-approved for HR+/HER2- disease after prior endocrine and chemotherapy, though it did not meet the overall survival endpoint in TROPION-Breast01. It is now being tested in the postneoadjuvant setting (TROPION-Breast03 trial). **Sacituzumab tirumotecan**, another TROP2-targeted ADC superior to chemotherapy in metastatic disease, is being evaluated postneoadjuvantly in the MK-2870-012 phase 3 trial. For HER2+ disease, **trastuzumab deruxtecan is being compared to T-DM1 in the postneoadjuvant setting** (DESTINY-Breast05 trial) after demonstrating improved overall survival in metastatic disease. Sacituzumab govitecan is being tested for HER2-negative residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy in the OptimICE-RD and SASCIA trials.

## Overcoming PARP Inhibitor Resistance

**DNA polymerase θ (POLθ) inhibitors** are under development to prevent BRCA reversion mutations, which account for 40-60% of PARP inhibitor resistance. Since 68% of reversions are mediated by microhomology- mediated end joining requiring POLθ, these inhibitors could maintain PARP sensitivity. **WEE1 inhibitors remain effective against revertant tumors** and represent another strategy. The IND.241 platform trial is evaluating **niraparib (PARP inhibitor) plus fulvestrant in patients with/without BRCA1/2 or PALB2 alterations**, testing whether this combination can overcome resistance in the CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant setting.

## Immunotherapy Combinations

**Multiple strategies are being tested to enhance immunotherapy response and overcome resistance:** **Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies:** The PANACEA trial investigated trastuzumab plus pembrolizumab in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ disease, achieving 15.2% ORR in PD-L1- positive patients. Preclinical data show that CDK4/6 inhibitors stimulate interferon-γ signaling and enhance antigen presentation, with synergy demonstrated when combined with PD-1 blockade. A phase 1b study of pembrolizumab plus abemaciclib showed 14.3% ORR and 60% stable disease at 16 weeks. **PARP inhibitors combined with checkpoint blockade:** Clinical activity has been reported for olaparib plus durvalumab in germline BRCA-mutated metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer, and niraparib plus pembrolizumab in unselected metastatic TNBC. The TOPACIO trial combining niraparib plus pembrolizumab achieved 21% ORR in unselected TNBC, with higher rates in BRCA-variant (47%) and PD-L1-positive (32%) patients. **Postneoadjuvant immunotherapy escalation:** Pembrolizumab is being tested in the SWOG1418 phase 3 trial for patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. The PD-L1 inhibitors avelumab (A-Brave trial) and atezolizumab (Astefania trial) are also under investigation in this setting.

## Emerging Targeted Therapies

**HER2-mutant disease (distinct from HER2-amplified):** Neratinib plus fulvestrant (category 2B) and neratinib plus trastuzumab plus fulvestrant (category 2A for ER+/HER2- patients post-CDK4/6 inhibitor) are recommended for HER2-activating mutations. These combinations showed promising results in the MutHER and SUMMIT trials. **Next-generation TRK inhibitors:** Repotrectinib is FDA-approved for NTRK fusion-positive tumors and may overcome resistance mutations that develop with first-generation TRK inhibitors like larotrectinib and entrectinib. **Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors:** Results of the entinostat E2112 trial are awaited, evaluating this epigenetic modulator in combination with endocrine therapy. **Yes, non-traditional radiation therapy methods including spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT/GRID), pulsed reduced dose-rate radiotherapy (PRDR), and FLASH radiotherapy are being actively investigated in breast cancer**, with emerging evidence suggesting these techniques may overcome resistance to conventional treatments through distinct radiobiological mechanisms.

## Spatially Fractionated Radiotherapy (SFRT/GRID) in Breast Cancer

**SFRT delivers highly heterogeneous dose distributions with high-dose peaks surrounded by low-dose valleys, showing promise for radioresistant and bulky tumors.** GRID therapy uses a 2-dimensional pattern of high-dose peaks (15-20 Gy), while lattice radiotherapy delivers a three-dimensional array of high-dose vertices (10-20 Gy) spaced 2-5 cm apart.[1] **Minibeam radiation therapy (MBRT), a form of SFRT with beam widths of 400-800 μm, has demonstrated the ability to overcome radioresistance in triple-negative breast cancer.** In preclinical TNBC models, MBRT (150 Gy peak dose) significantly reduced tumor growth, proliferation, and hypoxia while increasing necrosis compared to conventional radiotherapy at equivalent valley doses.[2]

Mechanistically, **MBRT downregulated HIF-1α/VEGFR signaling, alleviating hypoxia and angiogenesis, and enhanced vascular normalization via increased pericyte coverage**.[2]

These findings suggest MBRT reprograms the TNBC microenvironment to overcome hypoxia- mediated radioresistance. **For preoperative breast cancer treatment, photon mini-GRID therapy (mini-GRT) with beam widths of 1-2 mm has shown remarkable normal tissue sparing in dosimetric studies.** Compared to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plans, mini-GRT reduced mean dose to lungs, heart, chest wall, and lymph nodes by 50- 100%, while maintaining similar tumor integral doses.[3]

The mean dose to skin—the most challenging organ at risk—was reduced by 20-60% in most cases. **Mini-GRT also yielded sharper lateral penumbras in skin and lungs (size reduced by at least 50%)**, demonstrating potential for preoperative treatment with high skin and normal tissue-sparing capabilities.[3]

## Immunological Mechanisms of SFRT

**SFRT potentiates immune-mediated tumor control by creating protective reservoirs of the tumor immune microenvironment.** Agent-based modeling suggests that radiation-induced cancer cell death alone is insufficient for tumor clearance with whole tumor radiotherapy, but explicit consideration of radiation-induced anti-tumor immunity synergizes with radiation cytotoxicity to eradicate tumors. **For some pre-treatment tumor immune microenvironment compositions, SFRT-GRID may be superior to whole tumor radiotherapy in providing tumor control**.[4]

While there is agreement that SFRT modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, it remains unclear whether the anti-tumor immunity generated is more beneficial than that resulting from conventional radiotherapy.[5]

SFRT provokes release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activates innate immune pathways, potentially leading to immunogenic cell death and reshaping the tumor microenvironment.[6]

## Pulsed Reduced Dose-Rate Radiotherapy (PRDR)

**PRDR delivers the daily radiation dose of 2 Gy in 10 sub-fractions (pulses) with 3-minute intervals, creating an effective low dose rate of 0.067 Gy/min.** This technique exploits the hyper-radiosensitivity of tumor cells at small doses and reduced normal tissue toxicity at low dose rates.[7] **In breast cancer specifically, PRDR has shown promise for reirradiation of locoregional recurrence in previously irradiated regions.** A study of 17 patients with locoregional recurrent breast cancer reirradiated to the chest wall, axilla, or supraclavicular region using PRDR achieved a **2-year local control rate of 92%**.[8]
