**BRCA1/BRCA2 reversion mutations are the most well-documented mechanism of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in breast cancer** , occurring in approximately 40-60% of patients who develop resistance to PARP inhibitors or platinum chemotherapy. These reversions restore homologous recombination function and represent a dynamic evolutionary process during treatment. ## BRCA1/BRCA2 Reversion Mutations **BRCA1/2 reversion mutations emerge during treatment** and are detected in 60% of patients with metastatic BRCA1-, BRCA2-, or PALB2-mutant breast cancer who develop progressive disease on HRD-targeted therapy.[1] In clinical trials, BRCA reversion mutations were detected at progression in **34/79 (43%) breast cancer patients** receiving olaparib, compared to only 3/34 (9%) receiving chemotherapy.[2] Importantly, **reversions can be detected in circulating tumor DNA before clinical progression** in some cases, with 10 patients showing detectable reversions prior to radiographic progression.[1] The mechanisms generating these reversions are diverse. **A large proportion (68%) of BRCA reversion mutations are mediated by microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ)** , suggesting that DNA polymerase θ (POLθ) plays a key role.[2][3] Novel reversion mechanisms include: (i) intragenic BRCA1/2 deletions with intronic breakpoints, and (ii) intragenic BRCA1/2 secondary mutations forming novel splice acceptor sites.[1] Additionally, **de novo gene fusions can place BRCA1 under transcriptional control of a heterologous promoter** , resulting in BRCA1 re- expression despite retained promoter hypermethylation.[4] **When reversions are detected before commencing subsequent treatment, they associate with significantly shorter time to progression** .[1] Tumors with reversions retain HRD mutational signatures but have functional homologous recombination based on RAD51 status.[1][5] All patients whose tumors demonstrated RAD51 foci post-resistance were intrinsically resistant to subsequent lines of DNA-damaging therapy.[5] ## Non-Reversion Resistance Mechanisms in BRCA-Mutant Tumors **Loss-of-function mutations in TP53BP1, RIF1, or PAXIP1** represent non-reversion mechanisms that restore homologous recombination through increased DNA end resection.[1][5] These alterations were evident in patients with acquired resistance and **occasionally coexisted with reversions** , challenging the notion that singular resistance mechanisms emerge in each patient.[1] One patient acquired amplification of MRE11A, another mechanism promoting DNA end resection.[5] **Hypomorphic BRCA1 mutations** can also mediate resistance. The BRCA1^185delAG mutation can express a RING-less BRCA1 protein that confers resistance to HRD-targeted therapies.[6] Partial reduction in BRCA1 gene dose can modulate DNA replication stress levels, with some mutations resulting in both increased sensitivity and resistance depending on the specific functional consequences.[7] ## PIK3CA Mutations **PIK3CA mutations are among the most common alterations in breast cancer** and show dynamic changes during treatment. In metastatic breast cancer patients with multiline resistance, **PIK3CA mutations are frequent in HR+ patients** and appear in resistance profiles alongside TP53, MLL3, ERBB2, NOTCH2, and ESR1 mutations in patients progressing within 3-6 months of treatment.[8] PIK3CA mutations are classified as **tier IA evidence for actionability** based on large randomized trials showing benefit of PI3K inhibitors.[9] However, the relationship between PIK3CA mutations and chemotherapy resistance is complex. PIK3CA mutations were found in 27.9% of breast cancer patients and correlated with older age, but their direct role in chemoresistance requires further investigation.[10] The **PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is dysregulated in nearly 60% of TNBC cases** and plays a central role in chemoresistance by enhancing protein synthesis, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting DNA repair. ## MSI-H/dMMR Status **Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) is rare in breast cancer** , occurring in only 1-2% of cases.[11] These alterations are FDA-approved indications for pembrolizumab and dostarlimab.[12] There is limited data on how MSI-H/dMMR status changes with treatment resistance in breast cancer specifically, though the rarity of this phenotype suggests it is not a major driver of acquired resistance in most patients. ## RET Fusions **RET fusions are exceedingly rare in breast cancer** , and there is minimal published data on their prevalence or changes during treatment resistance. Selpercatinib is FDA-approved for RET fusion-positive solid tumors but is classified as category 2A evidence in breast cancer.[12] The scarcity of RET fusions in breast cancer limits understanding of resistance mechanisms specific to this alteration. ## Changes in Expression Levels Beyond mutations, **expression levels of BRCA1/BRCA2 change significantly during resistance development** . BRCA1 protein is not detected in therapy-sensitive tumors but is found in **31 out of 42 (74%) resistant cases** .[4] BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression decreases in post-chemotherapy residual tumors compared to pre- treatment samples (p=0.009 for BRCA2). **The genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancer shows that tumor mutational burden doubles compared to primary tumors** , and the contribution of specific mutational signatures shifts.[13] Signature 17 is significantly enriched in patients pretreated with fluorouracil, taxanes, platinum, and/or eribulin, while a de novo signature is associated with platinum-based chemotherapy pretreatment.[13] Would you like me to summarize the latest therapeutic strategies targeting these resistance mechanisms, particularly combination approaches using POLθ inhibitors to prevent BRCA reversions or WEE1 inhibitors that remain effective against revertant tumors? Would you like me to review the most recent clinical evidence on the utility and timing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) monitoring for early detection of resistance mutations—such as BRCA reversions—in breast cancer patients undergoing targeted therapy? This could help guide intervention strategies before clinical progression. ### References 1.
