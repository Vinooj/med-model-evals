Yes, there is growing evidence suggesting a correlation between radiomic features extracted from medical images (like CT or MRI) and tumor resistance to therapy. Several studies have demonstrated statistically significant correlations between specific radiomic signatures and various aspects of treatment response, including the development of resistance.

Here's a breakdown of the key points regarding this correlation:

1.  **Radiomics as Biomarkers for Resistance:** Radiomics involves extracting large amounts of quantitative data from medical images. These features can capture subtle variations in tissue texture, shape, intensity distribution, and spatial relationships within tumors that might not be apparent to the human eye. Researchers hypothesize that these complex characteristics reflect underlying biological processes related to tumor heterogeneity, angiogenesis, metabolism, and immune infiltration – all factors influencing therapeutic response and resistance.

2.  **Specific Examples & Studies:** Numerous studies across different cancer types have explored the link between radiomics and resistance:
    *   **Lung Cancer:** Some research has shown that certain radiomic features derived from pre-treatment CT scans correlate with EGFR mutation status and subsequent response/resistance to targeted therapies like gefitinib or erlotinib. Other studies suggest associations between radiomic profiles and resistance to chemotherapy or immunotherapy. For example, features reflecting increased vascularity or metabolic activity might predict poorer outcomes or faster progression after initial response.
    *   **Breast Cancer:** Radiomic analysis of mammograms or MRIs has been linked to HER2 status, hormone receptor expression, and chemoresistance. Features capturing tumor irregularity or spiculated margins sometimes correlate with more aggressive phenotypes and potential resistance.
    *   **Glioblastoma:** In brain tumors, radiomics has been investigated to predict MGMT methylation status (a biomarker for temozolomide sensitivity) and overall survival. Certain textural features may indicate higher cellular density or necrosis, potentially correlating with resistance.
    *   **Colorectal Cancer:** Studies are exploring how radiomic features on CT scans relate to KRAS mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI), and response to treatments like anti-EGFR antibodies (cetuximab).
    *   **Head and Neck Cancers:** Research suggests links between radiomic features and HPV status, smoking history, and response to chemoradiotherapy.

3.  **Mechanisms Linking Radiomics and Resistance:** The proposed connection lies in how imaging features represent underlying biology:
    *   **Tumor Heterogeneity:** Radiomic textures can quantify intra-tumoral heterogeneity, which is a major driver of acquired resistance. Different cell populations within a tumor respond
