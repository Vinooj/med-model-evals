This is a complex area of oncology because the answer depends heavily on the specific type of cancer (e.g., breast, rectal, lung). However, there are well-established biomarkers and mechanisms that address both parts of your question.

Here is a breakdown of the specific gene mutations associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy resistance and how radiotherapy influences gene expression.

### 1. Gene Mutations Predicting Resistance to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

Resistance is rarely defined by a single gene; it is usually a combination of mutations that alter DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, or drug transport.

#### **A. Breast Cancer (The most studied setting)**
*   **_PIK3CA_:** Mutations in this gene are often associated with resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, particularly in HER2-positive and ER-positive breast cancers. These tumors may respond better when targeted therapies (like PI3K inhibitors) are added.
*   **_TP53_:** The role of *TP53* is paradoxical. In some contexts (like estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer), *TP53* mutations predict resistance to anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy. However, in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), *TP53* mutations are ubiquitous and do not necessarily predict resistance; in fact, mutant tumors sometimes respond *better* to DNA-damaging agents because they cannot pause the cell cycle to repair the damage.
*   **_BCL2_:** High expression or amplification of this anti-apoptotic gene is a strong predictor of resistance, as the tumor cells are "primed" to survive the cell death signals triggered by chemotherapy.

#### **B. Rectal Cancer (Locally Advanced)**
*   **_KRAS_ and _BRAF_:** Mutations in these genes are standard biomarkers. While primarily known for predicting resistance to EGFR inhibitors (like cetuximab), they are also associated with lower rates of Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) to standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (5-FU/Capecitabine).
*   **Mismatch Repair Genes (_MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2_):** Tumors that are "Mismatch Repair Deficient" (dMMR) or MSI-High are notoriously resistant to standard 5-FU chemotherapy. However, they are highly sensitive to immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors).

#### **C. Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**
*   **_KEAP1_ and _STK11_ (LKB1):** These are emerging as major markers of resistance. Patients with *KEAP1* or *STK11* mutations generally have poor responses to both chemotherapy and immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.
*   **_ERCC1_:** High expression (often driven by genetic polymorphisms) predicts resistance to platinum-based chemotherapies (cisplatin/carboplatin) because the tumor is too efficient at repairing the DNA cross-links caused by the drug.

#### **D. General Mechanisms (Pan-Cancer)**
*   **_MDR1_ / _ABCB1_:** Genetic upregulation of this gene produces P-glycoprotein, a pump that physically ejects chemotherapy drugs from the cell, leading to multi-drug resistance.

### 2. Can Pre-operative Radiotherapy Influence Gene Expression?

**Yes, significantly.** Radiotherapy (RT) is not just a physical tool to burn tumor cells; it is a biological stressor that fundamentally alters the molecular landscape of the surviving tumor cells.

If a tumor is treated with radiation *before* or *during* chemotherapy, the radiation can induce changes in gene expression that may lead to **acquired resistance**.

#### **A. Upregulation of DNA Repair Genes**
Radiation causes double-strand DNA breaks. Tumor cells that survive radiation often do so by massively upregulating DNA repair pathways.
*   **Effect:** Post-radiation tumors often show increased expression of **_XRCC1_, _RAD51_, and _ATM_**.
*   **Consequence:** If chemotherapy (specifically platinum agents or PARP inhibitors) is administered after this upregulation, the tumor is now "super-charged" to repair the DNA damage caused by the chemo, rendering the drug less effective.

#### **B. Hypoxia-Induced Changes (_HIF-1α_)**
Radiation damages tumor blood vessels, leading to hypoxia (low oxygen).
*   **Effect:** Hypoxia stabilizes the **_HIF-1α_** transcription factor.
*   **Consequence:** _HIF-1α_ activates downstream genes like **_VEGF_** (promoting new blood vessels) and **_MDR1_** (drug efflux pumps). This means radiation can inadvertently turn on the genes that pump chemotherapy out of the cell.

#### **C. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)**
Radiotherapy can trigger a cellular program called EMT, where tumor cells change from a stationary state to a migratory, invasive state.
*   **Effect:** Radiation decreases expression of **E-cadherin** (adhesion) and increases expression of **Vimentin** and **Snail/Slug**.
*   **Consequence:** Cells undergoing EMT are inherently more resistant to chemotherapy and apoptosis (cell death). This is a known mechanism by which tumors metastasize or recur after radiation.

#### **D. Immune Checkpoint Upregulation**
*   **Effect:** Radiation causes inflammation, which triggers tumor cells to upregulate **_CD274_ (PD-L1)** as a defense mechanism.
*   **Consequence:** While this might make the tumor resistant to immune attack, it paradoxically makes the tumor **more sensitive** to immunotherapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) if used in the adjuvant setting.

### Summary for Clinical Context
1.  **Predicting Resistance:** We look for *KRAS* (rectal), *KEAP1* (lung), and *PIK3CA* or dMMR status to predict who will fail standard chemo.
2.  **Radiotherapy Impact:** RT changes the tumor biology. It can induce "survival phenotypes" (better DNA repair, EMT, drug pumps) that may make surviving cells harder to kill with subsequent chemotherapy. This is why **concurrent chemoradiation** (giving both at the same time) is often preferred over sequential treatment—it attacks the tumor before it has time to adapt its gene expression.
