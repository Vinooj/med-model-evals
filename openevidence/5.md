transcriptional RNA, etc.) **Resistance patterns—including gene mutations, protein expression, and transcriptional RNA profiles—show strong correlations with ER/PR/HER2 status and tumor grade, with more limited associations with TNM stage. ** correlated with TNM stage, grade, and ER/PR/HER2 status? How do these clinical factors affect resistance mechanisms? These clinical factors fundamentally shape the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance.

## ER/PR/HER2 Status and Resistance Mechanisms

**Subtype-specific resistance patterns are pronounced. ** In ER+ breast cancer, resistance mechanisms center on ESR1 mutations (acquired in 20-30% of metastatic cases), alterations in ER transcription, upregulation of FOXA1, cyclin D, c-myc, and altered receptor tyrosine kinase expression.[1]

Resistant ER+ tumors show elevated pathways including ER, HER2, GATA3, AKT, RAS, and p63 signaling.[2]

Specific defects in single-strand break repair proteins disrupt estrogen-regulated cell cycle control through the ATM, CHK2, CDK4 axis, directly coupling endocrine resistance to DNA repair defects.[3] **In HER2+ tumors** , low ER expression, high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and low cT-stage are associated with pathologic complete response (pCR).[4]

ER expression correlates with residual cancer burden (p=0.046), while PIK3CA mutations predict response to PI3K inhibitors in metastatic disease and pathological complete response in early disease.[5] **Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)** demonstrates distinct resistance profiles. Low PR expression (1-10%) pre-treatment associates with higher residual cancer burden (p[4]

TNBC shows common differentially expressed genes including FOS and NR4A1 across chemotherapy-resistant subtypes.[6]

Unlike ER+ tumors, proliferation- associated genes are not downregulated in post-treatment TNBC samples.[7]

TNBC is associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in 15-20% of cases.[5]

## Tumor Grade and Resistance

**Higher tumor grades correlate with distinct resistance profiles. ** Grade 3 tumors demonstrate higher Ki-67 proliferation indices (>20%), lower ER/PR expression, and higher recurrence scores compared to grade 1 tumors.[1]

Resistant patients show significantly higher tumor grades, intrinsic subtype risk scores, and upregulated cell-cycle gene sets in primary tumors.[8]

The molecular classification closely corresponds with tumor grade: **luminal A tumors (low-grade) are indolent and sensitive to antiestrogens, while luminal B and HER2+ tumors have incomplete sensitivity to endocrine therapy** .[9]

Basal-like tumors (typically high-grade) have aggressive natural history but can be especially sensitive to chemotherapy.[9]

## TNM Stage and Resistance

**TNM stage shows more limited direct correlation with specific resistance mechanisms** , though clinical and pathological T-stage (cpT-stage) has prognostic capacity in HER2+ tumors, and pre-treatment cpT-stage affects prognosis in TNBC.[4]

Low cT-stage is associated with pCR in HER2+ tumors (p=0.005).[4]

A systems biology analysis identified stage-specific gene modules: 21 genes for stage I, 17 genes for stage II, 10 genes for stage III, and 7 genes for stage IV , with hub genes including SMC4, FN1, FOS, JUN, KIF11, and RACGAP1.[10]

However, **the clinical prognostic stage integrates grade, HER2, ER, and PR status with TNM classification** , indicating that molecular features are more determinative than anatomic extent alone.[11]

## Integration of Clinical Factors

**The interplay between these factors is complex. ** Treatment-naïve samples reveal that expression levels of proliferation, immune response, and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization combined predict chemotherapy response, but **the direction of effect differs by subtype**: TNBC patients with high proliferation, high immune response, and low ECM expression have better response and survival (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.85; p=0.02), while in ER+ patients the opposite pattern predicts better outcomes (HR 4.73, 95% CI 1.51-14.8; p=0.008).[7]

Post-treatment changes also vary by subtype: **proliferation-associated genes are downregulated in post- treatment ER+ tumors but not in TNBC** , while ECM genes are upregulated across subtypes.[7]

Metabolism- associated gene sets are upregulated and estrogen-response gene sets downregulated in resistant patients' relapses compared to primary tumors.[8]

Would you like me to summarize the latest evidence on how specific resistance-associated gene mutations (such as ESR1, PIK3CA, and BRCA1/2) directly impact therapeutic decision-making and outcomes in different breast cancer subtypes, particularly regarding the selection and efficacy of targeted therapies?
