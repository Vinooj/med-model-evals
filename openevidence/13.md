**Yes, both radiotherapy and chemotherapy induce significant gene expression changes in breast cancer, and these alterations can be influenced by prior treatment exposure** , though the specific sequential effects of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (or vice versa) remain incompletely characterized in the literature. ## Radiotherapy-Induced Gene Expression Changes **Radiotherapy induces substantial transcriptional reprogramming in breast cancer tissue. ** In patients receiving neoadjuvant radiotherapy, tumor biopsies collected before and 7 days post-radiation showed increased infiltration of naive-like CD4 T cells and early activated CD8 T cell populations, while existing cytotoxic T cells were eliminated and myeloid cell populations increased.[1] At the gene level, radiation significantly upregulates genes involved in **p53 signaling, TNFA signaling, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and inflammatory response** , while downregulating genes involved in mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets.[2] In vivo studies of breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy (biopsies taken before and after 10 treatments of 2 Gy each) identified **several genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair as significantly induced by radiation treatment**.[3] The gene expression profiles observed were influenced by TP53 mutation status, with mutations found in 39% of tumors.[3] Radiation-induced changes appear to be **cell-line dependent and linked to hormone receptor status** , with specific gene and pathway signatures varying by subtype.[4] ## Chemotherapy-Induced Gene Expression Changes **Chemotherapy similarly induces transcriptional alterations that vary by treatment regimen and tumor subtype. ** In patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, **proliferation was reduced after treatment in both arms, most pronounced in the combination therapy arm where reduction accelerated during treatment** .[5] Transcriptional alterations during therapy were subtype-specific, with the effect of adding bevacizumab most evident for luminal B tumors.[5] In estrogen receptor-positive patients treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy, **elevated immune activity was associated with good response** .[5] The longitudinal analysis revealed that chemotherapy-induced alterations to gene expression result from both transcriptional reprogramming of tumor cells and subclonal adaptations to treatment.[5] ## Sequential Treatment Effects **The literature provides limited direct evidence on how chemotherapy specifically alters gene expression in patients who subsequently receive radiotherapy, or vice versa. ** However, several observations suggest important interactions: **Molecular basis of cross-sensitivity:** BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient tumors show marked sensitivity to both ionizing radiation and drugs that produce double-strand breaks.[6] The p53 protein is a major determinant of response to both ionizing radiation and cytotoxic drugs, though its effect is complex—impaired DNA repair is offset by reduced apoptosis.[6] This suggests that chemotherapy-induced alterations in DNA repair pathways could theoretically influence subsequent radiotherapy response. **Chemo-radiotherapy interactions occur at multiple levels:** (1) at the molecular level with altered DNA repair or modification of lesions induced by drugs or radiation, (2) at the cellular level through cytokinetic cooperation arising from differential sensitivity of cell cycle compartments, and (3) at the tissue level including reoxygenation, increased drug uptake, or inhibition of repopulation or angiogenesis.[7] Various mechanisms including cell synchronization and reoxygenation concur to paclitaxel-induced radiosensitization.[7] **Clinical context matters:** In a study of 64 breast cancer patients treated with primary chemotherapy (n=53) or radiotherapy (n=11), **p53 mutations were significantly associated with high S-phase fraction but not with de novo MDR1 gene expression** .[8] No correlation was observed between p53 mutations and the induction of MDR1 gene expression during treatment, suggesting that prior treatment may not universally alter resistance gene expression patterns.[8] ## Limitations and Knowledge Gaps The available literature predominantly examines gene expression changes induced by single modalities rather than sequential effects. **No studies in the provided references specifically compare gene expression profiles in patients who received chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy versus radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy. ** This represents an important knowledge gap, as understanding these sequential effects could inform optimal treatment sequencing and identify patients at risk for cross-resistance. The complexity of radiation-induced molecular changes—including effects on immunogenicity, tumor hypoxia, molecular heterogeneity, and plasticity—suggests that **prior chemotherapy exposure could theoretically modulate the tumor microenvironment in ways that alter subsequent radiotherapy response** , though this requires further investigation with appropriately designed sequential sampling studies.[9] Would you like me to summarize the latest evidence on specific chemotherapy-radiotherapy combinations (such as platinum agents, taxanes, or gemcitabine with radiation) and their molecular mechanisms of interaction, which might provide indirect insights into how prior chemotherapy could influence radiotherapy-induced gene expression changes? Would you like me to identify and summarize any prospective studies or clinical trials that have performed serial tumor biopsies and gene expression profiling in breast cancer patients undergoing sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to clarify the temporal and mechanistic changes in gene expression associated with treatment order? ### References 1.
