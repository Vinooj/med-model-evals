# Multiple mutations are already known to affect sensitivity to various targeted agents (ie BRCA 1/2, MSI-H, RET, PIK3CA, etc). How do expression levels of these genes/mutations change when a tumor develops resistance?

Changes in expression or function at resistance are highly context‑ and drug‑specific, but several recurring patterns are seen across targeted biomarkers. Most resistant tumors either restore the inhibited pathway (e.g., HR repair in BRCA‑mutant tumors) or bypass it through parallel signaling routes, rather than simply continuing the same baseline profile.

## BRCA1/2 and PARP‑ or platinum‑resistant tumors

In BRCA1/2‑deficient tumors initially sensitive to PARP inhibitors or platinum, resistance often reflects **re‑establishment of homologous recombination (HR)** rather than further loss.

- Secondary “reversion” mutations in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* can restore an open reading frame and functional protein, effectively increasing BRCA function from absent to partially restored and leading to PARP/platinum resistance.[^9]
- Other mechanisms upregulate HR without fixing the original mutation, for example by altered promoter control leading to re‑expression of *BRCA1*, or by changes in other HR factors (e.g., RAD51) that compensate functionally.[^5][^9]

In contrast, in BRCA‑wild‑type sporadic breast cancers treated with DNA‑damaging chemotherapy, **lower BRCA1 expression at baseline** is associated with greater sensitivity to anthracyclines, and higher expression correlates with relative resistance. This suggests that selection under therapy can enrich for clones with higher effective BRCA1/2 activity.[^3]

## PIK3CA and PI3K‑pathway–targeted therapy

For PI3K inhibitors (e.g., against PIK3CA‑mutant ER‑positive breast cancer), resistance frequently evolves by **bypassing PI3K dependence**, not necessarily by losing the original mutation.

- The *PIK3CA* mutation itself typically persists; expression levels of the mutant allele may not change dramatically, but downstream pathway output (AKT/mTOR) gets restored via amplification or activation of parallel RTKs (HER2, IGF1R), PTEN loss, or RAS/MAPK activation.
- In some models, feedback relief leads to increased upstream receptor expression and signaling, so total pathway activity can be higher at resistance despite continued PI3K inhibition.

Functionally, the driver mutation remains present, but the tumor’s transcriptional profile shifts toward a broader survival/DDR/EMT signature that makes PI3K signaling less uniquely essential.

## MSI‑H/dMMR and immune checkpoint resistance

For tumors with high microsatellite instability (MSI‑H) or mismatch‑repair deficiency (dMMR) treated with PD‑1/PD‑L1 blockade, resistance often involves **altering antigen presentation and interferon signaling**, rather than simply “losing” MSI‑H.

- The core MSI/dMMR genotype usually persists; however, resistant tumors can downregulate components of antigen presentation (e.g., B2M, HLA class I) or acquire JAK/STAT pathway alterations that reduce response to interferon‑γ.
- The net effect is a transcriptional shift from an inflamed, T‑cell–inflamed expression pattern to a more immune‑excluded or immune‑cold phenotype, even while MSI‑associated mutation burden remains high.

Thus, MSI‑H status is relatively stable, but the immune‑response gene signature changes dramatically at resistance.

## RET and other kinase targets

For kinase‑targeted therapies (RET, HER2, EGFR, ALK), resistance patterns are more analogous to classic TKI resistance in lung cancer:

- On‑target: Secondary mutations in the kinase domain can reduce drug binding while preserving kinase activity; these often change the qualitative behavior of the kinase rather than its overall expression level.
- Off‑target: Amplification or upregulation of bypass kinases and downstream nodes (e.g., MET, FGFR, RAS/RAF/MEK) can restore proliferation signals; expression of these bypass players is typically increased at resistance.

The original driver mutation generally remains detectable, but the “dependency” on that target is diluted by new amplified or overexpressed signaling alternatives.

## General patterns across these genes

Across BRCA1/2, PIK3CA, MSI‑H, RET, and similar markers:

- The **mutational status** of the predictive biomarker is often stable; resistance more commonly reflects secondary mutations, epigenetic changes, or network rewiring rather than complete loss of the original alteration.
- **Expression levels and transcriptional programs of surrounding pathways** (HR repair partners, RTKs, immune signaling genes, EMT/stemness factors) change more dramatically than the biomarker gene itself when resistance emerges.
- In BRCA‑deficient settings, resistance is characterized by *increased functional HR activity* (via reversion or compensation), whereas in kinase‑ and PI3K‑targeted settings, resistance is characterized by *restored downstream signaling* and upregulation of bypass tracks; in MSI‑H, resistance is characterized by *loss of effective immune recognition* rather than loss of MSI.
