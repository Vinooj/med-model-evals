Yes. The authors discuss the relationship between various biomarkers of intrinsic or acquired resistance and patient characteristics such as age, race, menopausal status, tumor histology, hormone receptor status, HER-2 status, tumor grade, and stage in some detail. For example, they note that high expression levels of P-glycoprotein are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk for recurrence among node-negative patients but not among node-positive patients; this may be due to chemotherapy treatment effects on nodal disease burden. They also describe how different combinations of markers predict response to specific therapies better than single markers alone.
