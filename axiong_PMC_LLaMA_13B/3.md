Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents can be intrinsic (innate) or acquired. Intrinsic resistance refers to the inherent ability of a tumor cell to resist a particular cytotoxic agent and is related to qualitative differences in molecular structure of the target. Acquired resistance may arise through mutation or selection and has been discussed above with regard to gene-specific therapies. Some examples include myc-gene translocations in Burkitt's lymphoma that confer resistance to methotrexate; multidrug resistance genes mediating resistance to natural product anticancer drugs such as the vinca alkaloids and taxanes; and amplification of the bcl2 oncogene which confers resistance to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents.
