# In the neoadjuvant setting, are there specific gene mutations that will predict tumor resistance to chemotherapy prior to surgery?  Can pre-operative radiotherapy influence these gene expression levels?

In the neoadjuvant setting there are indeed genomic and transcriptomic features that enrich for resistance to chemotherapy, but there is no single mutation that reliably “guarantees” resistance across regimens and subtypes. Instead, predictive information tends to come from: (1) multi‑gene DNA repair mutation panels, (2) broader mutation patterns at baseline, and (3) gene‑expression signatures; pre‑operative radiotherapy can further reshape these expression programs in ways that may influence chemosensitivity.[^1][^3][^4][^5]

## Mutations predicting poor neoadjuvant chemo response

Evidence is most developed for triple‑negative and high‑risk HER2+ disease, and depends on the regimen.

- **Single recurrent mutations (limited predictive power)**
    - In a TNBC cohort receiving paclitaxel–carboplatin neoadjuvant therapy, common mutations in *TP53*, *BRCA1/2*, *PIK3CA*, *PTEN* and others did **not** differ significantly in frequency between pCR and non‑pCR groups, suggesting that single mutations alone are poor stand‑alone predictors of resistance.[^1]
    - In larger TNBC analyses, chemoresistant tumors are more likely to carry alterations in genes such as *BRCA1*, *ATR*, *ARID1A*, *XRCC3*, and tubulin‑associated genes, while chemosensitive tumors more often harbor mutations in genes like *COL1A2*, *APOBEC3B*, *PALB2*, and histone genes; however, the patterns are probabilistic rather than deterministic.[^2][^10]
- **DNA repair gene panels (HR pathway)**
    - For TNBC treated with paclitaxel–carboplatin, a panel of 10 homologous recombination–related genes (*PALB2*, *CHEK2*, *BRCA2*, *RAD51D*, *BRCA1*, *RAD51C*, *BRIP1*, *ATM*, *RAD50*, *BARD1*) distinguished responders from non‑responders: 75–78% of patients with at least one deleterious mutation in this panel achieved pCR, versus a substantially lower pCR rate in mutation‑negative patients.[^1]
    - This illustrates that *HR deficiency* generally predicts **chemosensitivity** to DNA‑damaging neoadjuvant regimens, whereas HR‑proficient tumors (lacking these alterations) are more likely to be resistant, particularly in TNBC.[^5][^1]
- **Baseline mutation patterns and residual disease**
    - Whole‑exome sequencing of pre‑ and post‑neoadjuvant TNBC biopsies shows that chemoresistant residual tumors are enriched for mutations affecting phosphorylation/signaling pathways, while mutations in genes involved in adhesion, cytoskeleton, and DNA repair are depleted, consistent with selection of clones optimized for survival and signaling plasticity.[^2]
    - In ER+/HER2– disease, residual tumors after neoadjuvant chemo often acquire or enrich alterations in cell‑cycle, PI3K/AKT, and ESR1/FGFR pathways, but many of these can already be present at baseline, and their value as pre‑treatment resistance predictors is still being defined.[^9][^5]


## Gene-expression signatures predicting neoadjuvant resistance

Transcriptional programs tend to outperform single mutations as predictors of pre‑operative chemo response.

- A 12‑gene expression signature built from neoadjuvant‑resistant breast cancer cell lines and patient data stratifies patients into high‑ and low‑risk groups for neoadjuvant resistance; resistant tumors show upregulated DNA repair and metabolic pathways and downregulated membrane receptor signaling.[^4]
- Other neoadjuvant studies highlight that responders demonstrate immune activation and suppression of PI3K‑Akt and AGE–RAGE signaling, whereas non‑pCR tumors show reduced cytokine/immune receptor activity, emphasizing that an “immune‑cold” baseline expression phenotype predicts resistance even before therapy starts.[^3][^6]

In practice, multigene signatures (HRD scores, proliferation/immune modules, neoadjuvant‑response signatures) are more clinically promising than any single mutation for predicting pre‑surgical chemoresistance.

## Can pre‑operative radiotherapy alter gene expression and impact chemo response?

Pre‑operative or concurrent radiotherapy can substantially modify tumor gene expression, with potential effects on how tumors respond to systemic agents:

- **Radiation-induced expression changes**
    - Radiation activates DNA damage–response, checkpoint, and apoptotic genes and represses proliferative transcripts, generating a “radiation response” signature that is measurable in both experimental models and patient tumors.[^11][^12]
    - Radiation also modulates immune and inflammatory gene expression (e.g., interferon and antigen‑presentation pathways), which overlaps with the immune activation seen in chemo‑responsive tumors and can influence subsequent sensitivity to cytotoxic or immunomodulatory drugs.[^12][^13]
- **Implications for neoadjuvant chemo**
    - Because DNA‑damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy share much of the same DDR and interferon‑related transcriptional circuitry, pre‑operative radiation could theoretically:
        - Sensitize tumors to certain agents if delivered in a way that augments pro‑apoptotic and checkpoint signaling at the time chemotherapy is given.
        - Promote cross‑resistance if it induces sustained upregulation of DNA repair and interferon‑related “resistance signatures” before chemotherapy.
    - The net effect likely depends on sequence, dose, and tumor subtype; current clinical practice still largely separates standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and robust, subtype‑specific predictive models that fully integrate both pre‑op RT‑induced and baseline expression patterns are not yet standard.[^14][^5][^12]


## Practical takeaways for the neoadjuvant setting

- Single mutations like *TP53*, *PIK3CA*, or *BRCA1/2* are insufficient alone to predict neoadjuvant resistance across regimens, although HR‑deficiency panels can predict **sensitivity** to platinum‑based NAC in TNBC.[^5][^1]
- Multi‑gene expression signatures capturing DNA repair, proliferation, and immune activity provide better pre‑operative risk stratification for chemoresistance than isolated genomic lesions.[^6][^3][^4]
- Pre‑operative radiotherapy clearly alters gene expression in overlapping DDR and immune pathways, but how best to leverage this to enhance or avoid resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains an area of ongoing research rather than settled practice.[^11][^12][^14]

If you specify a concrete clinical scenario (e.g., stage II TNBC receiving paclitaxel→AC vs paclitaxel–carboplatin, or locally advanced HER2+ disease on neoadjuvant TCHP with consideration of pre‑op RT), the relevant mutation panels and expression signatures for that setting can be discussed in more detail.
