**Resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer is associated with multiple gene mutations, altered protein expression patterns, and distinct transcriptional RNA profiles** that vary by breast cancer subtype and treatment modality. ## Gene Mutations and Genetic Alterations **TP53 mutations** are prominently associated with chemotherapy resistance, with somatic TP53 mutations being common in anthracycline-sensitive groups while other mutations appear in resistant groups.[1] However, p53's role is complex—while mutations contribute to resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy, impaired DNA repair is offset by reduced apoptosis.[2] **BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations** show contrasting effects: BRCA1- or BRCA2- deficient tumors demonstrate marked sensitivity to ionizing radiation and drugs producing double-strand breaks, though their expression decreases in post-chemotherapy residual tumors.[2][3] Mutations in **CDKN1B** appear only in pre-treatment samples, while **APC and CTNNB1** mutations emerge only post-treatment.[4] ## Protein Expression Patterns **Drug efflux transporters** play critical roles in chemoresistance. **ABCB1 (MDR1)** is the most frequently overexpressed gene in resistant cells, with high MDR1 expression significantly associated with poor response (17% vs 68% in low expressors, p=0.005) and poor progression-free survival.[5][6] **ABCB5, CYP1A1, and CYP4Z1** are significantly upregulated in anthracycline-resistant groups.[1] Additional xenobiotic metabolism genes including **CYP3A4 and CYP2A6** show enrichment in non-responders to anthracycline-taxane therapy.[7] **DNA repair proteins** demonstrate subtype-specific patterns. Lower expression of **PALB2 and ERCC1** in pre-treatment biopsies correlates with pathologic complete response (p=0.005 and p=0.009).[3] **P4HA2** (Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase Subunit Alpha 2) is upregulated in radioresistant cells and promotes resistance through enhanced stemness and DNA damage repair; its knockdown synergizes with radiotherapy.[8] **Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)** are involved in cross-resistance between tamoxifen and radiotherapy, with increased expression in both resistant phenotypes correlating with poor outcomes in patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen or radiotherapy.[9] ## Transcriptional RNA Levels **Common differentially expressed genes** across chemotherapy-resistant subtypes include **FOS and NR4A1** .[10] In radioresistance, **ORAI3 and BCAM** distinguish non-responders with high AUC values (>0.75), while the amino acid transporter[7] **SLC7A5** shows significantly higher expression in resistant tumors.[7] **Pathway-specific alterations** include activation of MAPK, ErbB, PI3K-Akt, mTOR, Wnt, and RAS signaling pathways in chemoresistant tumors.[11] **Proliferation-associated genes** are downregulated in post-treatment ER+ tumors but not in triple-negative breast cancer, while[4] **extracellular matrix (ECM) genes** are upregulated in the majority of post-chemotherapy samples across subtypes.[4] **Immune-related genes** show distinct patterns: **LYN, LY96, and ANXA1** are upregulated in patients with relapse within 60 months.[7] Chemoresistant tumors demonstrate increased infiltration of CD4 memory T cells, regulatory T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells.[10] **NOTCH1 and MAPK14** emerge as hub genes in protein-protein interaction networks.[12] ## Non-Coding RNAs **MicroRNAs** play substantial roles in both chemoresistance and radioresistance. **miR-21** promotes radioresistance via cancer stem cells, while[13][14] **miR-196a-5p** is upregulated and **miR-4472** is downregulated in chemoresistant tissues.[12] Tumor suppressor miRNAs including **miR-22, miR-200c, and Let- 7** increase radiotherapy efficacy.[13] **Long non-coding RNAs** including **HOTAIR and NEAT1** are associated with radioresistance, while[15][13] **LINP1** functions as a tumor suppressor enhancing radiotherapy effects.[13] These ncRNAs regulate cell cycle, DNA damage repair, apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, and cancer stem cell properties.[16] A **17-gene signature** combining methylation and miRNA-regulated genes showed predictive and prognostic power in triple-negative breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline-taxane neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[17] The findings emphasize that resistance mechanisms are highly individualized, with patients exhibiting distinct molecular rewiring that converges into limited dysregulated functional modules.[18] Would you like me to summarize which of these molecular markers—mutations, protein expressions, or RNA profiles—have the strongest evidence for clinical utility as predictive biomarkers of therapy resistance, and whether any are currently used or validated in routine breast cancer management? ### References 1.
