# What therapeutic options are being developed to overcome resistance?  Are any experimental drugs under clinical investigation?

Therapeutic strategies to overcome breast cancer resistance increasingly combine approved agents with novel inhibitors targeting resistance pathways like HR restoration, fork protection, immune evasion, and bypass signaling, with several experimental drugs in clinical trials.[^1][^2][^10][^11]

## Strategies for PARP inhibitor resistance

Approaches focus on blocking reversion mutations, stabilizing forks, or enhancing synthetic lethality.

- Combinations with ATR/CHK1 inhibitors (e.g., berzosertib, prexasertib) prevent fork protection and gap filling in BRCA-mutant cells, showing preclinical synergy and early trial activity in TNBC.[^10][^11]
- WEE1 inhibitors (e.g., adavosertib) exploit G2/M checkpoint dependency in HR-deficient tumors post-PARPi, with phase II data in platinum-resistant ovarian/breast cancer.
- HDAC inhibitors (e.g., entinostat) reverse epigenetic HR restoration; ongoing trials test them with olaparib in BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer.[^11]


## Experimental drugs in trials

Multiple candidates address specific resistance mechanisms.


| Drug/Agent | Target/Mechanism | Trial Context/Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Saruparib (AZD5305) | PARP1/2 inhibitor (next-gen, less trapping-dependent) | Phase III (EvoPAR-Breast01) vs CDK4/6i + ET in BRCA1/2/PALB2-mutated HR+/HER2– advanced BC; recruiting as of 2025 [^4] |
| Omomyc | MYC inhibitor (DNA-damaging, resensitizes PARPi-resistant TNBC) | Preclinical; synergizes with olaparib by inducing DNA damage in MYC-high resistant cells [^6] |
| STING agonists (e.g., systemic formulations) | Converts pro-tumor M2 macrophages to anti-tumor M1, overcomes BRCA-mut breast cancer PARPi resistance | Preclinical to early trials; enhances PARP inhibitor efficacy via immune reprogramming [^2] |
| HSP90 inhibitors (low-dose) | Destabilizes buffered BRCA1 mutations, exposes vulnerabilities in resistant cells | Preclinical; proposed combo with PARPi for BRCA1-driven resistant BC [^5] |
| p97/TEX264 inhibitors | Blocks toxic PARPi adduct recycling in TNBC | Preclinical Oxford project; aims to resensitize resistant cells [^1] |

## Broader resistance-overcoming approaches

- For chemo/radiotherapy resistance: ATR/WEE1 inhibitors, PROTACs targeting DNA repair proteins (e.g., RAD51 degraders), and immune combos (e.g., PARP + anti-PD1).
- Endocrine/CDK4/6 resistance: Next-gen SERDs (elacestrant, camizestrant) + PI3K inhibitors (inavolisib for PIK3CA-mut).
- Immunotherapy resistance: TIGIT/LAG-3 bispecifics (e.g., vibostolimab) or ADCs like sacituzumab govitecan in PD-L1+ TNBC post-IO.

Phase III trials like EvoPAR-Breast01 emphasize sequencing (post-CDK4/6i) and biomarkers (POLQ/Shieldin/53BP1 expression) to select patients least likely to develop resistance. Real-world data support PARPi post-CDK4/6i in BRCA-mutated HR+ disease, with median PFS ~12 months.[^4][^8]
