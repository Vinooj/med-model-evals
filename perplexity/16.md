# Is there data in the literature to suggest that pre-operative radiotherapy can reduce the rate of resistance?  If so, what gene expression levels change when radiotherapy is added?

Yes, literature supports that preoperative radiotherapy (pre-op RT), often after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), can reduce resistance rates by increasing pathologic complete response (pCR) in non-responders, particularly in HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), enabling more breast-conserving surgeries.[^1][^2][^3]

## Evidence for reduced resistance

Clinical data from observational cohorts and small trials indicate pre-op RT boosts pCR in NAC partial responders or non-responders.

- In a cohort of 37 NAC non-complete responders (T1-3 N+, non-metastatic), pre-op RT yielded 18.9% breast pCR and 37.8% axillary pCR, with HER2+ and TNBC subtypes showing significantly higher responses (p=0.029); this converted nearly 38% to breast-conserving surgery without major toxicity increases.[^2][^4]
- Pooled analyses of small neoadjuvant chemoradiation studies (n=105 locally advanced cases) reported ~33% partial/complete pathologic responses pre-surgery, with 5-year locoregional recurrence at 5% versus 6-13% for NAC alone, suggesting pre-op RT mitigates residual resistant clones.[^3]
- SEER database reviews and pilot studies confirm pre-op RT downstages tumors (10-26% pCR rates), activates antitumor immunity (abscopal effects), and is safe for mastectomy/reconstruction, independent of NAC response.[^6][^1]

These benefits are most pronounced in bulky or NAC-refractory tumors, where pre-op RT targets residual disease before surgery.

## Gene expression changes with added pre-op RT

Pre-op RT induces a characteristic transcriptional response overlapping with chemotherapy effects, potentially reversing resistance signatures.

- **Upregulated genes**: DNA damage response/checkpoint factors (*GADD45A*, *XPC*, *PPM1D*), interferon/inflammatory pathways (type I IFN, antigen presentation), and pro-apoptotic mediators; these enhance immune activation and eliminate micrometastases, countering immune-cold resistance phenotypes seen in NAC non-responders.[^11][^12][^1]
- **Downregulated genes**: Proliferation/mitosis transcripts and survival signaling (e.g., PI3K/AKT modules), shifting tumors from resistant proliferative states to checkpoint-arrested, immunogenic profiles.[^12][^11]
- In combined NAC + pre-op RT, expression shifts include robust antitumor immunity activation (absent post-surgery RT) and reduced hormone receptor/HER2-enriched resistance pathways, correlating with higher pCR in ER-low/HER2+ cases.[^1][^2]

These changes—measurable via pre/post-RT biopsies—likely explain synergy, as RT preconditioning sensitizes residual clones to immune clearance and apoptosis. Larger randomized trials (e.g., NCT05274594) are ongoing to validate.[^2]
