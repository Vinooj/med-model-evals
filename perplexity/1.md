# Which gene mutations (protein expression patterns, transcriptional RNA levels, etc.) are associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer?

Breast cancer resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is driven by a mix of recurrent DNA mutations, copy-number changes, and characteristic RNA/protein expression programs, many of which converge on drug metabolism, DNA damage repair, cell survival, and tumor–immune interactions. Different intrinsic subtypes (luminal A/B, HER2-enriched, triple-negative/basal-like) show distinct resistance-associated patterns rather than a single universal “resistance gene.”[^1][^2][^3][^4]

## Major pathways in chemoresistance

Several functional groups of genes repeatedly associate with poor response to standard anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy and to DNA‑damaging agents.

- **Drug metabolism and transport**
    - Overexpression of xenobiotic metabolism genes such as *CYP3A4* and *CYP2A6* correlates with non‑response to combined anthracycline–taxane regimens, consistent with increased drug inactivation.[^1]
    - Transporters such as the amino‑acid importer *SLC7A5* are upregulated in resistant tumors and metastases, and high expression distinguishes non‑responders from responders to anthracycline–taxane therapy.[^1]
- **Survival, inflammation, and microenvironment**
    - Resistant tumors show enrichment of inflammatory and innate immune response genes, including *LYN*, *LY96* (MD‑2), and *ANXA1*, in patients with early relapse after anthracycline–taxane chemotherapy.[^1]
    - Activation of NF‑κB signaling, with increased IKKα/IKKβ and nuclear *RELA/p65*, is a hallmark of trastuzumab‑resistant HER2+ luminal B cells that acquire a more basal‑like, aggressive phenotype.[^5]
- **Intrinsic subtype context**
    - Luminal A/B tumors, HER2‑enriched, and triple‑negative/basal‑like cancers differ systematically in proliferation, DNA repair capacity, and receptor signaling pathways, shaping their baseline sensitivity and routes to resistance.[^3][^4]
    - For HER2‑negative patients receiving taxane–anthracycline therapy, a 4‑gene signature including *SRPK1* (serine/arginine protein kinase 1) and three additional genes stratifies prognosis; resistant, basal‑like tumors tend to show elevated *SRPK1* and reduced expression of the other signature genes.[^6]


## Selected chemoresistance-associated genes

The table highlights representative genes and expression patterns repeatedly linked to chemotherapy resistance or poor outcome, focusing on RNA/protein levels rather than single rare mutations.


| Functional group | Gene / pattern | Resistance association |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Drug metabolism | High *CYP3A4*, *CYP2A6* mRNA in pre‑treatment tumors | Enrichment in non‑responders to anthracycline–taxane; supports increased drug catabolism and reduced effective dose.[^1] |
| Amino‑acid transport | High *SLC7A5* expression in primary and metastatic lesions | Distinguishes non‑responders; linked to high proliferative, metabolically active tumors with poor outcome after anthracycline–taxane therapy.[^1] |
| Innate immunity / inflammation | Upregulated *LYN*, *LY96*, *ANXA1* | Overexpressed in tumors from patients relapsing within 5 years after anthracycline–taxane, implicating inflammatory signaling in resistance.[^1] |
| Splicing / signaling (HER2– disease) | Elevated *SRPK1* with reduced expression of three partner genes in a 4‑gene signature | Signature identifies HER2‑negative patients with poor response and prognosis on taxane–anthracycline regimens; *SRPK1* upregulation is prominent in basal‑like tumors.[^6] |
| HER2 signaling and downstream survival | Persistent HER2 overexpression with constitutive NF‑κB activation (IKKα/β↑, nuclear *RELA/p65*↑) in trastuzumab‑resistant luminal B cells | Defines trastuzumab‑resistant HER2+ clones that adopt a HER2+ basal‑like phenotype; NF‑κB inhibition partially restores drug sensitivity.[^5] |

## DNA repair and radiotherapy resistance

Radiotherapy and many chemotherapies kill cells by inducing DNA damage, so genes in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints are central to radioresistance.[^2]

- **DNA repair gene expression and radiosensitivity**
    - A recent synthesis highlights that robust activity of homologous recombination (HR), non‑homologous end joining (NHEJ), and base‑excision repair (BER) pathways supports survival after ionizing radiation, while defects can either sensitize or, through compensatory rewiring, sometimes promote resistance.[^2]
    - A DNA‑repair–based “radiosensitivity index” built from the expression of a defined panel of 10 repair genes stratifies breast tumors into more radio‑sensitive and radio‑resistant groups, with specific mutational patterns (e.g., in HR and BER components) over‑represented in the resistant cohort.[^7]
- **Endocrine resistance and cross‑resistance to radiation**
    - In ER‑positive models rendered tamoxifen‑resistant, only a limited set of DNA damage repair genes change more than two‑fold, including upregulation of *NEIL1* and *EME2* and downregulation of *PCNA*, *BRIP1*, and *BARD1* at the RNA level.[^8]
    - Despite these alterations, expression of these individual genes did not significantly correlate with clinical outcome after radiotherapy in a large patient cohort, suggesting that cross‑resistance to radiation in tamoxifen‑resistant disease is not explained by simple, linear changes in repair gene expression alone.[^8]


## Integrating transcriptional patterns and clinical predictors

Rather than single markers, multigene expression signatures currently provide the most robust predictors of therapy response.

- A genomic predictor constructed from pre‑treatment tumor expression profiles can stratify patients receiving sequential taxane followed by anthracycline into high‑response and low‑response groups, with higher scores associated with increased pathologic complete response and improved survival.[^9]
- For HER2‑negative patients on taxane–anthracycline combinations, a 4‑gene signature incorporating *SRPK1* yields independent prognostic information beyond tumor size, nodal status, TNM stage, and PAM50 subtype, underscoring the importance of pathway‑level transcriptional programs in resistance.[^6]

If you share a specific therapeutic context (e.g., neoadjuvant AC‑T, adjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent endocrine therapy, or HER2‑targeted regimens) and subtype, a more targeted list of mutations and expression patterns relevant to that setting can be outlined.
