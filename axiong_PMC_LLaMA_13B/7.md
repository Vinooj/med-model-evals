The development of drug resistance is an ongoing process during cancer treatment. As the tumor cells proliferate and evolve in order to evade the effects of chemotherapy, they acquire increasing numbers of mutations that allow them to survive despite exposure to cytotoxic drugs. Some of these mutations may involve genes whose protein products are directly or indirectly involved with cellular defense mechanisms against chemotherapeutic agents. For example, some breast cancers exhibit increased expression of genes such as ERBB2 and GRB7, which encode proteins involved with signal transduction pathways downstream from EGFR family receptors; this finding has been correlated with relative resistance to antiEGFR therapies like trastuzumab. Similarly, overexpression of the RAS gene product HRAS has been associated with decreased response rates to cetuximab in colorectal cancer patients. Other examples include amplification of the BRAF gene, leading to constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, which confers resistance to MEK inhibitors, and upregulation of the MYC gene, resulting in enhanced apoptosis and reduced responses to antiangiogenic agents.
