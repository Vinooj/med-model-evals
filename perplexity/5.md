# Are these resistance patterns (or genes, proteins, transcriptional RNA, etc.) correlated with TNM stage, grade, and ER/PR/HER2 status?  How do these clinical factors affect resistance mechanisms?

Resistance mechanisms in breast cancer are strongly shaped by ER/PR/HER2 status and grade, and more weakly and indirectly by TNM stage. The same broad families of mechanisms (e.g., DNA repair, efflux, EMT, stemness, epigenetic change) are used across tumors, but which ones dominate and which genes/RNAs are involved depend heavily on subtype and tumor aggressiveness.[^1][^4][^6]

## Relationship to ER/PR/HER2 status

Hormone receptor and HER2 status largely define both the initial therapy and the resistance programs that emerge.

- ER‑positive / HER2‑negative (luminal)
    - Resistance is often driven by alterations in **ER signaling** (ESR1 mutations, ER downregulation, loss of ER co‑factors) and activation of alternative growth pathways (PI3K–AKT–mTOR, CDK4/6, MAPK).[^4][^1]
    - Epigenetic changes and non‑coding RNAs that suppress ERα expression (e.g., ZEB1‑mediated promoter methylation, lncRNAs such as H19 and TINCR) are enriched in endocrine‑resistant luminal tumors and correlate with loss of ER and endocrine failure.[^1]
- HER2‑positive
    - Resistance to trastuzumab and other HER2‑targeted agents is associated with HER2 pathway re‑wiring, activation of parallel receptors (IGF1R, ERBB family), and downstream PI3K–AKT signaling.[^4][^1]
    - HER2‑specific epigenetic events such as hypermethylation and silencing of TGFBI, and upregulation of certain lncRNAs (e.g., AGAP2‑AS1) are reported largely in HER2‑positive, trastuzumab‑resistant tumors, not in other subtypes.[^1]
- Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC)
    - TNBC lacks ER, PR, and HER2, and shows prominent use of **EMT, cancer stem cell traits, and DNA damage response** programs to resist chemotherapy and radiotherapy.[^4][^1]
    - m6A‑modified non‑coding RNAs and specific lncRNA/miRNA networks that promote EMT, stemness, and DNA repair are especially highlighted in TNBC chemoresistance (e.g., to anthracyclines and taxanes).[^1][^4]


## Relationship to grade and biological aggressiveness

Histologic grade captures proliferation and differentiation, which correlate with certain resistance genes and programs.

- High‑grade tumors
    - High grade associates with frequent TP53 mutations, HER2 (c‑erbB‑2) overexpression, Bcl‑2 negativity, and other features linked to doxorubicin and chemotherapy resistance.[^3][^1]
    - Highly proliferative, poorly differentiated tumors are more likely to use EMT, stemness, and robust DNA repair/DDR activation, and to exhibit complex epigenetic reprogramming and non‑coding RNA changes that drive multidrug resistance.[^4][^1]
- Low‑grade tumors
    - Low‑grade, luminal tumors more often exhibit endocrine‑specific resistance pathways (ER pathway rewiring, ESR1 mutations, co‑regulator changes) and may acquire chemoresistance later in disease course.[^6][^1]
    - Gene‑expression‑based indices that combine grade with nodal status (e.g., prognostic indices) link higher grade with molecular signatures of proliferation and therapy resistance.[^6]


## Relationship to TNM stage

Stage (especially metastatic vs early) correlates with resistance mainly through exposure history and underlying biology, rather than a unique “stage‑specific” gene.

- Early vs advanced local disease
    - TNM primarily reflects tumor size and lymph‑node involvement; these are prognostic but do not correspond to one specific resistance gene set.[^3][^6]
    - Nonetheless, higher T/N categories often co‑occur with more aggressive molecular subtypes (e.g., HER2+, TNBC) and higher grade, which carry more intrinsic resistance mechanisms such as strong DDR, EMT, and immune evasion pathways.[^6][^4]
- Metastatic (M1) disease
    - By the time breast cancer is metastatic, resistance patterns are shaped by prior therapies and clonal selection; metastatic lesions often show enrichment of resistance drivers (ESR1 mutations in pretreated ER+ disease, PI3K pathway mutations, epigenetic silencing of drug‑sensitivity genes, overexpression of efflux pumps).[^1][^4]
    - Metastatic site preferences also differ by subtype (e.g., higher liver metastasis rates in TNBC and HER2+), reflecting underlying molecular programs (angiogenesis, invasion, DDR) that also contribute to resistance.[^4]


## How clinical factors modulate mechanisms

- Clinical factors such as ER/PR/HER2 status and grade determine first‑line therapy (endocrine, HER2‑targeted, or chemotherapy) and therefore which resistance pathways are under selection pressure (hormone signaling vs HER2 signaling vs generic DNA damage tolerance).[^1][^4]
- These clinical variables correlate with specific genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic landscapes (e.g., luminal vs HER2‑enriched vs basal‑like), which in turn dictate the dominant resistance machinery: ER‑centric changes in luminal disease, HER2 pathway and epigenetic silencing in HER2+, and EMT/DDR/stemness/ncRNA reprogramming in TNBC.[^6][^4][^1]
