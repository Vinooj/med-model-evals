h chemotherapy and radiotherapy? a. Are there specific mutations that lead to cross resistance? **TP53 mutations and alterations in DNA repair genes, particularly BRCA1/BRCA2, are associated with cross- resistance to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer** , though their effects can be complex and context-dependent.

## TP53 Mutations TP53 mutations contribute to resistance to both chemo- and radiotherapy, though the mechanism involves a trade-off:

**impaired DNA repair is offset by reduced apoptosis** .[1]

Somatic TP53 mutations are common in anthracycline-sensitive groups, while other mutations appear in resistant groups.[2]

In triple-negative breast cancer, TP53 mutations are frequently observed and may influence treatment response.[3]

## BRCA1/BRCA2 Alterations The role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in cross-resistance is paradoxical.

**BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient tumors demonstrate marked sensitivity to ionizing radiation and drugs producing double-strand breaks** .[1]

However, BRCA1 dysfunction leads to enhanced sensitivity to DNA damaging therapeutic agents, while p53 mutations contribute to resistance.[4]

Notably, **BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression decreases in post-chemotherapy residual tumors** , and BRCA2 shows lower expression in post-treatment samples compared to pre-treatment biopsies (p=0.009).[5]

## DNA Repair Pathway Genes Several DNA repair genes show altered expression patterns associated with treatment resistance: -

**ATM**: Shows lower expression in post-treatment residual tumors (p=0.004), though ATM protein plays a significant role in determining response to therapy[5][1] - **PALB2 and ERCC1**: Lower expression in pre-treatment biopsies correlates with pathologic complete response (p=0.005 and p=0.009)[5] - **FANCA and PARP1**: Demonstrate lower expression in post-treatment samples[5]

## Interferon-Stimulated Genes

**Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are involved in cross-resistance between tamoxifen and radiotherapy** .[6]

Increased ISG expression in both resistant phenotypes correlates with poor outcomes in patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen or radiotherapy, suggesting a shared resistance mechanism across treatment modalities.[6]

## Drug Metabolism Genes

**Xenobiotic metabolism genes including CYP3A4, CYP2A6, ABCB5, CYP1A1, and CYP4Z1** are significantly upregulated in anthracycline-resistant groups, and may contribute to broader treatment resistance patterns.[2][7]

The molecular mechanisms underlying cross-resistance appear highly individualized, with patients exhibiting distinct molecular rewiring that converges into limited dysregulated functional modules.[8]

This heterogeneity suggests that single-agent targeted therapy is unlikely to be effective, and combination strategies targeting multiple resistance pathways simultaneously may be necessary.[9]

Would you like me to summarize the latest clinical evidence on how these specific gene mutations (such as TP53, BRCA1/2, and DNA repair pathway genes) impact the effectiveness of current targeted therapies or combination regimens in breast cancer patients with documented cross-resistance? This could help guide treatment decisions for cases where standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy have failed.
