Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been used in the management of medically operable patients with early-stage lung cancer as an alternative to surgery. It is also being investigated for use in the treatment of metastatic disease, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The rationale behind its use are improved local control and survival rates compared with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy; reduced toxicity due to smaller volumes of irradiated normal tissue; and outpatient convenience. Mediastinal lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis remains a key prognostic factor negatively influencing overall survival in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, there is little data on the role of mediastinoscopy in the staging evaluation of limited-disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC), especially among patients who present with LD-SCLC and are candidates for aggressive locoregional therapies such as thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) plus concurrent chemotherapy (CC).
