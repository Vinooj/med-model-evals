It is difficult to estimate how much time elapses between a patient becoming MT and developing drug resistance. However, there are several factors that influence this process. Firstly, different tumors have varying intrinsic rates at which they acquire secondary mutations; secondly, some drugs induce specific mechanisms of resistance more frequently than others; thirdly, host genotype influences both rate of acquiring resistance as well as susceptibility to particular agents; finally, other treatment related variables such as dose intensity and schedule may impact emergence of resistance
