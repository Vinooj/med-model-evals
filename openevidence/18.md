Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR/SBRT) demonstrates significant efficacy in oligoprogressive breast cancer that has developed resistance to systemic therapy, though the benefit appears more modest compared to non-small-cell lung cancer. The effects differ from conventional radiotherapy primarily through ablative dose delivery, enhanced immune activation, and vascular endothelial injury mechanisms. Clinical Efficacy in Systemic Therapy-Resistant Disease The CURB trial, the first randomized phase 2 study of SBRT in oligoprogressive breast cancer, demonstrated that adding SBRT to standard-of-care systemic therapy significantly prolonged progression-free survival in the overall cohort (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24-0.60; p<0.0001). However, when analyzed by disease type, the benefit was substantial for NSCLC patients (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17-0.52) but not statistically significant for breast cancer patients (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27-0.99; p=0.045 in univariate analysis, p=0.53 in multivariable analysis). Critically, patients in the SBRT group remained on their current systemic therapy for longer (median 8.1 months vs 5.3 months, p=0.014), delaying the need to switch to potentially more toxic regimens. None of the 111 irradiated lesions among the 55 patients in the SBRT group progressed, demonstrating excellent local control. Notably, 59% of patients in the standard-of-care group received salvage SBRT after progression, suggesting clinical recognition of its value even off-protocol. For definitive treatment of primary breast cancer in nonsurgical candidates, SBRT (40 Gy/5 fractions) achieved 100% local control at 6 months and 93.3% at 12, 24, and 36 months, with median tumor size reduction of 20.8% at first follow-up and 62% at second follow-up. SUV reduction was even more dramatic at 65.2% and 88%, respectively. Radiobiological Mechanisms Unique to SABR SABR induces complex DNA double-strand breaks that robustly activate DNA damage response pathways, particularly via ATM and ATR kinases. The ablative doses (typically ≥8-10 Gy per fraction) exceed the threshold for conventional radiobiological principles, with effects that cannot be fully explained by the linear-quadratic model or the traditional 4 Rs of radiobiology (reoxygenation, repair, redistribution, repopulation). Vascular endothelial injury represents a critical mechanism distinguishing SABR from conventional radiotherapy. High-dose radiation induces endothelial apoptosis and blood perfusion reduction, which may enhance tumor cell response to radiation. This vascular damage contributes to the ablative effect beyond direct tumor cell killing. Preclinical studies suggest that combining SABR with anti-angiogenesis therapy shows promising efficacy and good tolerance in advanced cancers. Enhanced immune activation is a hallmark of SABR. SABR provokes release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activates innate immune pathways, potentially leading to immunogenic cell death and reshaping the tumor microenvironment. SABR is more powerful in enhancing antitumor immunity than conventional fractionation radiotherapy and works better with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The combination of SABR with ICIs has become a practical option for metastatic cancer patients. Differences From Conventional Radiotherapy Dose and fractionation: SABR delivers ablative doses (15-21 Gy single fraction or 19.5-31.5 Gy in 3 fractions for preoperative breast SBRT) compared to conventional fractionation (1.8-2 Gy per fraction over 5-7 weeks). The biological effective dose calculated using the LQ model can represent tumor control probability from a clinical perspective, though the model's appropriateness for SABR remains debated based on preclinical data. Precision and volume: SABR delivers radiation with sub-millimeter precision, dramatically reducing irradiated volumes of healthy tissue. Preoperative SBRT significantly reduces overall treatment time and enables minimization of volumes, with excellent cosmetic effects (85-100% excellent outcomes) and low toxicity (G2 toxicity in 0-17% acutely, 0-19% late). Hypoxia considerations: Despite relatively small tumor size in SABR candidates, hypoxia remains common and has negative effects on efficacy. Preliminary studies indicate that hypoxic radiosensitizers combined with SABR may be feasible, though adequate evidence for routine practice is lacking. Resistance Mechanisms and Genomic Determinants Tumors with proficient DNA repair capabilities often resist SBRT, whereas deficiencies in key repair genes render them more susceptible. Radiogenomic profiling has identified genomic alterations associated with differential SBRT responses. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes may impair p53-dependent apoptosis and disrupt cell cycle checkpoints, allowing malignant cells to evade radiation-induced cell death. In triple-negative breast cancer specifically, radioresistance is driven by both tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms (enhanced DNA damage repair, hypoxia adaptation, survival pathway activation, cancer stem cells) and tumor immune microenvironment processes (immunosuppressive cells, impaired antitumor immune response). Advanced techniques like SBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery have improved precision and reduced toxicity, though radioresistance remains a significant challenge. Clinical Context and Limitations The NRG-BR002 study reported that ablative radiotherapy did not confer a survival benefit in oligometastatic breast cancer, contrasting with positive results in oligometastatic NSCLC. The ECOG-ACRIN 2108 trial showed no improvement in progression-free or overall survival with early local therapy (surgery plus radiotherapy) in metastatic breast cancer, with survival worsening 3.3-fold in triple-negative disease. These conflicting results suggest that patient selection is critical. Predictors of good prognosis after SBRT include favorable biological subtype (hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative), solitary metastasis, bone-only metastasis, and long metastasis-free interval. The use of local ablative SBRT should always be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board. For preoperative SBRT, pathologic complete response rates vary substantially, showing higher rates (up to 42%) with longer intervals between SBRT and surgery and when combined with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (up to 90%). This suggests that allowing time for radiation-induced biological changes to manifest may be important. Would you like me to summarize the latest evidence on combining SBRT with radiosensitizing agents (such as DNA damage repair inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors) specifically for breast cancer patients who have developed resistance to systemic therapy, including any ongoing clinical trials evaluating these combination strategies? Given the nuanced efficacy of SABR in systemic therapy-resistant breast cancer and the emerging role of combination strategies, I would encourage you to delve deeper into the current clinical evidence and ongoing trials evaluating the integration of SABR with immune checkpoint inhibitors or DNA damage repair inhibitors in this patient population. Would you like me to provide a focused review of the most promising combination approaches and their impact on outcomes in resistant breast cancer? 19. Are there any non- traditional radiation methods that have been used to study resistance patterns and/or overcome resistance? (By non- traditional, I
