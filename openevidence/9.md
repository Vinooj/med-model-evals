istance patterns? Is there literature that demonstrates a consistent and statistically **Yes, there is a consistent and statistically significant association between radiomics features and resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy in breast cancer** , with multiple published studies demonstrating that radiomic analysis can predict treatment response, though the evidence for radiotherapy resistance is more limited. ## Radiomics and Chemotherapy Resistance significant correlation between radinomics and resistance mechanisms? **Radiomics has been spotlighted as an imaging biomarker for estimation of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), which is regarded as the main reason for resistance to tumor treatment** .[1] Multiple studies demonstrate consistent predictive performance across different imaging modalities and patient cohorts. **Prediction of Pathological Complete Response:** Radiomics effectively predicts pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy with high accuracy. A multicenter study of 586 patients showed that radiomics of multiparametric MRI (RMM) achieved an AUC of 0.86 for predicting pCR, significantly higher than clinical models in external validation cohorts.[2] Meta- analysis of 14 studies including 2,722 breast cancers confirmed that all MRI-derived radiomic features improved predictive accuracy compared to conventional biomarkers.[3] **Intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic analysis yields AUCs of 0.74-0.78 for pCR prediction** , with receptor status-specific analysis improving performance to AUCs of 0.83 in HR+/HER2- tumors and 0.93 in triple- negative/HER2+ tumors.[4] Post-NAC MRI radiomics are the most accurate imaging method, with during-NAC and post-NAC MRI showing significantly better predictive accuracy than pre-NAC MRI (OR: 0.14 and 0.26, respectively).[3] **Temporal Dynamics and Resistance Patterns:** **Longitudinal radiomics analysis demonstrates superior performance in predicting treatment response** . Studies using multiparametric MRI before and during NAC achieved AUCs of 0.909-0.981 for distinguishing different residual cancer burden (RCB) categories.[5] Delta-radiomics features (changes during treatment) from synthetic MRI outperformed pre-treatment features, with the optimal noncontrast clinical-radiomics model achieving AUCs of 0.916/0.914/0.850 across training/validation/test cohorts.[6] **Radiomic signatures predict diverse tumor shrinkage patterns associated with survival outcomes** . A multitask learning model using 17 radiomic signatures achieved AUCs of 0.886 for predicting tumor shrinkage patterns and 0.760 for pCR.[7] Critically, nonpCR patients with concentric shrinkage had significantly better survival than those with non-concentric shrinkage (p=0.00012 for OS, p=0.00063 for RFS).[7] ## Biological Mechanisms Underlying Radiomics **Radiogenomics analysis reveals that radiomic features correlate with specific molecular pathways and resistance mechanisms** . Gene expression analysis demonstrated that IL-17 and estrogen signaling pathways are involved in response variability.[7] Radio-multiomic studies uncovered metabolic dysregulation underlying radiomic signatures, including ATP metabolic processes (NES=1.84, p-adjust=0.02) and cholesterol biosynthesis (NES=1.79, p-adjust=0.01).[8] A significant correlation exists between radiomics and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), with deep learning- based radiomics models achieving AUCs of 0.79 and 0.77 for noninvasive quantification of key lncRNAs in training and testing cohorts.[9] This demonstrates that **radiomic features reflect underlying epigenetic molecular characteristics** that drive treatment resistance. Predicted pCR groups show active immune and inflammatory pathways, while non-pCR groups demonstrate stronger cell proliferation and tumor invasion processes.[10] The direction of effect differs by subtype: TNBC patients with high proliferation, high immune response, and low extracellular matrix expression have better response (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.85), while ER+ patients show the opposite pattern (HR 4.73, 95% CI 1.51- 14.8).[7] ## Prognostic Value and Clinical Utility **Radiomic signatures demonstrate independent prognostic value for recurrence-free survival and overall survival** . A thirteen-feature radiomic signature validated across three cohorts (FUSCC, DUKE, I-SPY1) significantly predicted RFS and OS (all p[8] The Radiomic DeepSurv Net model achieved AUCs of 0.98, 0.94, and 0.92 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year RFS prediction, with validation AUCs of 0.91-0.94.[9] CT-based radiomics nomograms incorporating clinical characteristics achieved AUCs of 0.82 in training and 0.79 in validation cohorts for NAC response prediction, with significantly higher overall net benefit than clinical models alone (z=2.811, p=0.005).[11] ## Radiotherapy Resistance The provided literature focuses predominantly on chemotherapy resistance, with **limited published evidence specifically addressing radiomics prediction of radiotherapy resistance in breast cancer** . The metabolic radiomics study using F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated associations with Ki67 expression and recurrence risk, but did not specifically evaluate radiotherapy resistance patterns.[1] Would you like me to summarize the latest evidence on how specific radiomic features—such as texture heterogeneity patterns or peritumoral characteristics—could be integrated into clinical decision-making algorithms to guide treatment selection and identify patients at highest risk for developing resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy? Would you like me to review and synthesize the literature on radiomics-based prediction of resistance specifically to radiotherapy in breast cancer, including any emerging imaging biomarkers or multi-omics approaches that may help identify patients at risk for radiotherapy failure? ### References 1.
