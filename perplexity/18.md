# How does stereotactic ablative radiotherapy affect tumors that have developed resistance to systemic therapy?  How does this differ from conventional radiation?

Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR, also called SBRT) can effectively target and ablate resistant breast cancer tumors by delivering ultra-high doses in 1-5 fractions, often overcoming systemic therapy resistance through direct cell killing, vascular damage, and immune activation, unlike conventional radiation's more gradual cytoreduction.[^1][^3]

## SABR effects on resistant tumors

SABR excels against systemic-resistant lesions (e.g., post-chemo, endocrine, or targeted therapy failure) due to its ablative potency.

- Delivers 20-50 Gy in few sessions to small volumes (<5 cm), overwhelming repair in resistant clones with upregulated DNA repair (e.g., HR-proficient post-PARPi) or survival pathways, achieving 80-90% 2-year local control vs 30-40% for conventional RT in inoperable cases.[^4][^1]
- Induces immunogenic cell death via high-dose endothelial damage and antigen release, triggering abscopal effects (distant tumor regression) even in "immune-cold" resistant tumors; preclinical data show SABR resensitizes via cGAS-STING activation, unlike low-dose RT.[^3]
- Case series in NAC-refractory or inoperable early-stage breast cancer report complete resolution (e.g., 25 Gy single fraction yielding 7-month remission) and pCR rates up to 42% when used pre-surgery, converting to breast conservation.[^1]


## Differences from conventional radiation

Conventional RT (e.g., 40-50 Gy/15-25 fractions) relies on sublethal damage accumulation, while SABR's hypofractionation bypasses resistance via distinct biology.


| Aspect | SABR | Conventional RT |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Dose/fraction | Ablative (8-25+ Gy) | Low (1.8-2 Gy) |
| Mechanism | Direct ablation, vascular collapse, strong immunogenicity | DNA damage repair overload, reoxygenation over weeks |
| Sessions | 1-5 | 15-30+ |
| Resistant tumors | Overcomes via fork collapse, no repair time; 80-90% control | Relies on 4 Rs (repair/reoxygenation); 30-40% control in resistant/inoperable |
| Toxicity | Low (steep fall-off, small margins 1-2 mm) | Higher skin/fibrosis risk over larger fields |
| Immune effect | Potent (abscopal potential) | Milder inflammation |

SABR's precision suits oligoresistant metastases or bulky residuals post-systemic failure, with trials (e.g., NRG-BR007) testing it neoadjuvantly; conventional RT remains standard for whole-breast post-lumpectomy.[^5][^4][^1]
