In the neoadjuvant setting, certain gene mutations and expression profiles can indeed predict tumor resistance to chemotherapy. For example, mutations in the TP53 gene are often associated with resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents. Similarly, overexpression of the MDR1 gene, which encodes P-glycoprotein, can lead to multidrug resistance by actively pumping drugs out of cancer cells. Other genes, such as those involved in DNA repair pathways (e.g., BRCA1/2 mutations), can also influence sensitivity or resistance to specific chemotherapies.

Gene expression profiling, such as the Oncotype DX or MammaPrint tests in breast cancer, can provide insights into the likelihood of response to chemotherapy. These tests analyze the expression of multiple genes to predict the benefit of chemotherapy and the risk of recurrence.

Pre-operative radiotherapy can influence gene expression levels, potentially altering the tumor's biology and its response to subsequent treatments. Radiotherapy can induce changes in the tumor microenvironment, affect DNA repair mechanisms, and modulate immune responses, all of which can impact gene expression. For instance, radiation can induce the expression of genes involved in stress responses, apoptosis, and inflammation. These changes might either sensitize the tumor to chemotherapy or, conversely, lead to adaptive resistance mechanisms.

Overall, the interplay between genetic mutations, gene expression, and treatment modalities like chemotherapy and radiotherapy is complex. Personalized treatment strategies that consider these factors are crucial for optimizing therapeutic outcomes in the neoadjuvant setting.
