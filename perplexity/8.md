# Where do mutation patterns overlap and differ between the various histologies: IDC, ILC, inflammatory, etc?

Across histologic types like invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and inflammatory breast cancer, there is substantial overlap in core driver mutations, but each subtype has characteristic patterns in certain genes and mutational processes. In practice, histology “tilts” the probability of specific alterations and signatures rather than defining entirely unique, non‑overlapping genetic landscapes.[^1][^6][^8]

## Shared core alterations across histologies

- Many common invasive types (IDC of no special type, classic ILC, micropapillary, mucinous, metaplastic) share frequent mutations in **PIK3CA, TP53, GATA3, and ER‑pathway genes**, with differences in exact frequencies rather than presence vs absence.[^6][^1]
- Copy‑number alterations (e.g., gains and losses across the genome) show broadly similar patterns between metastatic ILC, mucinous, micropapillary, metaplastic cancers and metastatic IDC of no special type when stage and ER/HER2 status are matched; overall fraction of genome altered (FGA) is comparable, though certain subsets (e.g., metastatic ILC) can have higher FGA.[^1]


## IDC vs ILC

- **Cadherin and adhesion genes**
    - ILC is strongly associated with inactivation of *CDH1* (E‑cadherin), which is much less frequent in classic IDC.[^6][^1]
    - IDC typically lacks the near‑pathognomonic combination of E‑cadherin loss plus the lobular growth pattern that characterizes ILC.
- **ESR1 and ERBB2 in metastatic ILC**
    - Metastatic ILC frequently harbors alterations in *CDH1* (≈70–80%), *PIK3CA* (≈50%), and additional changes in *TP53, ERBB2, TBX3, NCOR1*, and *NF1*; some of these, like *ERBB2* and *ESR1* hotspot mutations, are enriched in metastatic ILC compared with matched metastatic IDC‑NST.[^1]
    - *ESR1* and *ERBB2* mutations in ER‑positive ILC tend to be mutually exclusive and act as acquired resistance mechanisms to endocrine therapy; similar patterns can occur in IDC, but the specific spectrum and frequencies differ.[^1]
- **Mutational processes**
    - Metastatic ILC has been reported to show a higher mutational burden and more frequent APOBEC mutational signatures than primary ILC and matched metastatic IDC‑NST, suggesting histology‑linked differences in how mutational processes shape progression.[^1]


## Special histologic types (micropapillary, metaplastic, mucinous)

- **Micropapillary carcinomas**
    - Metastatic micropapillary cancers show frequent alterations in *PIK3CA* (~50–60%) and *TP53* (~40%), similar to common forms of breast cancer, but metastatic lesions can acquire additional *ESR1* and *ERBB2* mutations and alterations in *KDR, ARID1B,* and *ATR* that are less prominent in primary tumors.[^1]
- **Metaplastic carcinomas**
    - Metaplastic breast cancers, compared with triple‑negative IDC‑NST, more often harbor mutations affecting the **PI3K/AKT/mTOR and canonical Wnt pathways**.[^1]
    - *TP53* is extremely frequent (approaching 80–100%), and metastatic metaplastic tumors can acquire additional alterations such as *CCND1* and *SOX9* not seen in matched primaries; *PIK3CA* mutations can be enriched in metastatic chondroid or squamous metaplastic subtypes.[^1]
- **Mucinous and other special types**
    - Mixed mucinous carcinomas can accumulate *ESR1* and *NCOR* mutations in the metastatic setting, reflecting endocrine‑therapy resistance, whereas many of their baseline drivers overlap with ER‑positive IDC.[^1]


## Inflammatory breast cancer

- Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is defined clinically/pathologically more than by a single histologic pattern, but molecular studies suggest:
    - High frequency of **ERBB2 amplification and overexpression**, frequent **TP53 mutations**, and signatures of high proliferation and angiogenesis, overlapping considerably with aggressive HER2‑positive or basal‑like IDC.[^8][^6]
    - Distinct transcriptional patterns involving immune, angiogenic, and invasion pathways that are more characteristic of IBC than of classic IDC or ILC, even when ER/HER2 status is similar.[^8]


## How overlap vs difference is best understood

- Overlap: Many histologies share a common “toolbox” of drivers and resistance genes—*PIK3CA, TP53, ERBB2, ESR1, GATA3, NCOR1, NF1, RB1*, among others—with variations in frequency and combinations rather than unique gene sets.[^6][^1]
- Differences:
    - ILC is distinguished by *CDH1* loss plus enrichment for *PIK3CA* and specific *ERBB2* and *ESR1* mutation patterns and higher APOBEC/HRD influence in the metastatic setting.[^1]
    - Metaplastic cancers are skewed toward PI3K and Wnt pathway mutations and very high *TP53* rates.[^1]
    - Micropapillary and mixed mucinous carcinomas show IDC‑like cores but acquire subtype‑specific patterns (e.g., *ESR1/ERBB2* mutations in metastatic lesions).[^1]
    - Inflammatory breast cancer overlays a strong angiogenesis/immune/invasion program on top of IDC‑like or HER2‑enriched or basal‑like backgrounds.[^8][^6]

Overall, histology modifies the probability and combination of key mutations and mutational signatures, while ER/HER2 status and intrinsic molecular subtype remain the primary axes along which mutation patterns and resistance mechanisms are organized.[^6][^8][^1]
