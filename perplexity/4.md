# What percentage of metastatic breast cancer patients eventually develop resistance to 1st line systemic therapy?  What about 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th line therapy?

Published studies do not report a single, simple percentage of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients who “eventually” develop resistance at each line; instead they show that **nearly all** patients who live long enough on systemic therapy ultimately progress on each given line, with attrition and biology determining how many ever reach later lines. Numerically, real‑world and trial data imply that the proportion of patients who progress on 1st‑line is already well over 70–80% over several years, and those who remain controlled without ever becoming resistant are a small minority.[^1][^6][^7]

## Why exact percentages are hard to give

- Resistance is usually inferred from disease progression (radiographic/clinical) rather than directly measured, and follow‑up times differ across studies.[^1]
- Rates also vary markedly by subtype (HR+/HER2− vs HER2+ vs triple‑negative), treatment backbone (endocrine + CDK4/6 inhibitor vs chemotherapy vs HER2‑targeted therapy), and patient fitness, so a single “universal” number is misleading.[^3][^6][^7]


## First‑line systemic therapy

- For HR‑positive/HER2‑negative MBC, current standards use endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor; median progression‑free survival (PFS) in major trials is on the order of 20–28 months, which implies that most patients eventually progress on 1st‑line over a few years.[^6][^7]
- In broader mixed‑subtype cohorts, first‑line objective response rates are typically 40–60% and median PFS around 10–18 months; consequently, the vast majority of patients progressing through long‑term follow‑up are considered to have developed resistance to that first regimen.[^3][^1]


## Second‑line and beyond

- With each additional line, both PFS and response rates fall; for example, trials of second‑ or third‑line targeted or chemotherapeutic regimens in HER2+ or triple‑negative MBC often report median PFS in the 4–9‑month range, indicating rapid acquisition or selection of resistant disease.[^3]
- Real‑world data show that a high proportion of patients who are well enough to receive a second line will also progress on that regimen within a year or two, and only a subset survive and remain fit to receive third‑ or fourth‑line therapy.[^1][^3]


## Attrition across lines of therapy

- Observational work on treatment “attrition” suggests that a large majority of patients started on 1st‑line systemic therapy do reach 2nd‑line, but the fraction reaching 3rd or 4th line drops progressively because of both resistance and declining performance status.[^8]
- Practically, among patients who live long enough and remain eligible for further treatment, progression (i.e., functional resistance) after 2nd, 3rd, and later lines becomes nearly universal, with benefit windows that shrink with each successive regimen.[^8][^3]


## How to interpret this clinically

- Conceptually, systemic therapy in MBC is almost always palliative and time‑limited in efficacy; resistance to each line is expected, not exceptional, and treatment planning focuses on sequencing effective options rather than preventing resistance entirely.[^7][^6]
- When thinking in percentages, it is more accurate to ask, “What proportion of patients are progression‑free at time X on line N?” rather than “What fraction never become resistant?”, because over long enough time horizons almost all metastatic tumors eventually escape each line of therapy.[^1][^3]
