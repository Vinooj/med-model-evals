e mutations that will predict tumor resistance to chemotherapy prior to surgery? Can pre- operative radiotherapy influence these gene expression levels? **Yes, specific gene mutations and expression patterns can predict tumor resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery** , with the most robust predictors varying by breast cancer subtype. Preoperative radiotherapy does induce significant gene expression changes, though its specific influence on chemotherapy resistance markers remains incompletely characterized.

## Predictive Gene Mutations for Chemotherapy Resistance

**PIK3CA mutations are consistently associated with reduced chemotherapy sensitivity. ** In neoadjuvant studies, PIK3CA mutations correlated with lower pathologic complete response (pCR) rates (p=0.040 for ypT0/isypN0), and patients with PIK3CA mutations showed reduced sensitivity to anthracycline-taxane-based NAC. High tumor mutational burden (TMB) and specific mutational signatures predict better response: **mutation signature 3 (BRCA-mediated DNA repair deficiency) was significantly associated with higher pCR rates** (median signature weight 24% in pCR vs. 0% in residual disease, p=0.007). **TP53 mutations show complex, subtype-dependent effects. ** TP53 mutations were associated with higher pCR rates overall (p=0.019 for ypT0/isypN0 and p=0.003 for ypT0/is), though the effect varies by molecular context. In contrast, **CCND1 amplification (p=0.042) and MAPK pathway alterations (p=0.043) predict reduced NAC sensitivity** . **Novel resistance markers include CDKAL1 P409L missense variant** , which decreased breast cancer cell sensitivity to docetaxel, and **amplifications of ADGRA2 and ADRB3 at 8p11.23** , which were uniquely present in NAC nonresponsive tumors and associated with worse response and poor prognosis. Conversely, deletion at 3p13 harboring FOXP1 was found in NAC responsive tumors.

## DNA Repair Gene Expression as Predictive Biomarkers

**Lower expression of PALB2 and ERCC1 in pre-treatment biopsies correlates with pathologic complete response** (p=0.005 and p=0.009, respectively). After adjustment for tumor grade and molecular subtype, PALB2 and ERCC1 remained significantly lower in the pCR group (p=0.014 and p=0.040). These alterations in DNA repair could represent suitable targets for therapy selection. Post-NAC analysis revealed that **BRCA2, ATM, FANCA, and PARP1 showed lower expression in residual tumor samples compared to pre-NAC biopsies** , suggesting dynamic changes in DNA repair capacity during treatment.

## Gene Expression Signatures and Proliferation

**Proliferation signatures are the dominant predictors of chemotherapy response, accounting for 90.5% of predictive signatures in ER+/HER2- disease and 63.3% in triple-negative breast cancer. ** Within each receptor- based subgroup, tumors with high proliferation signature scores were significantly more likely to achieve pCR. **Proliferation-independent predictive signatures differ by subtype:** In ER+/HER2- breast cancer, immune activity signatures predict response independent of proliferation, while in TNBC, proliferation-independent signatures include immune response, DNA damage pathways, PI3K/AKT/Ras/EGFR signaling, and stemness phenotypes. Treatment-naïve samples reveal that **the direction of effect differs by subtype**: TNBC patients with high proliferation, high immune response, and low extracellular matrix (ECM) expression have better response and survival (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.85; p=0.02), while in ER+ patients the opposite pattern predicts better outcomes (HR 4.73, 95% CI 1.51-14.8; p=0.008).

## Preoperative Radiotherapy Effects on Gene Expression

**Preoperative radiotherapy induces biphasic molecular changes: early proliferation reduction and DNA damage within days, followed by adaptive immune activation within weeks. ** In the YOUNGSTER trial of 20 early-stage breast cancer patients receiving preoperative RT boost (5 × 2.67 Gy), early post-RT samples (3-5 days) showed significant downregulation of proliferation genes, PAM50 proliferation signature, and Ki67 IHC staining, along with increased DNA damage (γH2AX) and macrophage marker upregulation. In primary surgery samples collected 2-8 weeks post-RT, **adaptive immune markers showed significant upregulation, along with a 14-gene immunoglobulin signature increase** . Single-cell RNA sequencing from another cohort demonstrated increased infiltration of naive-like CD4 T cells and early activated CD8 T cell populations 7 days post-radiation, while existing cytotoxic T cells were eliminated and myeloid cell populations increased. **At the gene level, radiation significantly upregulates genes involved in p53 signaling, TNFA signaling, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and inflammatory response** , while downregulating genes involved in mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets. Several genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair were significantly induced by radiation treatment.

## Interaction Between Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy Resistance

**The specific influence of preoperative radiotherapy on chemotherapy resistance gene expression patterns remains underexplored in the literature. ** While radiotherapy clearly modulates proliferation and DNA repair pathways—the same pathways that predict chemotherapy response—no studies directly compare chemotherapy resistance markers before and after preoperative radiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. The radiation-induced downregulation of proliferation genes could theoretically reduce chemotherapy sensitivity, since high proliferation predicts better chemotherapy response. However, the immune activation induced by radiotherapy might enhance subsequent immunotherapy efficacy, supporting potential combinatorial approaches. Would you like me to summarize the clinical utility of commercially available gene expression assays (Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, PAM50) for predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response when performed on core needle biopsies, and whether any prospective trials are evaluating their use to guide neoadjuvant treatment selection? Given the gaps in direct evidence, I would suggest we delve into the latest studies or ongoing clinical trials that specifically evaluate how preoperative radiotherapy alters the expression of chemotherapy resistance genes in breast cancer—especially focusing on whether these molecular changes translate into clinically meaningful differences in neoadjuvant treatment outcomes. Would you like me to identify and summarize such research? 16.
