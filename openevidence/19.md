**Yes, non-traditional radiation therapy methods including spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT/GRID), pulsed reduced dose-rate radiotherapy (PRDR), and FLASH radiotherapy are being actively investigated in breast cancer** , with emerging evidence suggesting these techniques may overcome resistance to conventional treatments through distinct radiobiological mechanisms.

## Spatially Fractionated Radiotherapy (SFRT/GRID) in Breast Cancer

**SFRT delivers highly heterogeneous dose distributions with high-dose peaks surrounded by low-dose valleys, showing promise for radioresistant and bulky tumors. ** GRID therapy uses a 2-dimensional pattern of high-dose peaks (15-20 Gy), while lattice radiotherapy delivers a three-dimensional array of high-dose vertices (10-20 Gy) spaced 2-5 cm apart.[1] **Minibeam radiation therapy (MBRT), a form of SFRT with beam widths of 400-800 μm, has demonstrated the ability to overcome radioresistance in triple-negative breast cancer. ** In preclinical TNBC models, MBRT (150 Gy peak dose) significantly reduced tumor growth, proliferation, and hypoxia while increasing necrosis compared to conventional radiotherapy at equivalent valley doses.[2]

Mechanistically, **MBRT downregulated HIF-1α/VEGFR signaling, alleviating hypoxia and angiogenesis, and enhanced vascular normalization via increased pericyte coverage** .[2]

These findings suggest MBRT reprograms the TNBC microenvironment to overcome hypoxia- mediated radioresistance. **For preoperative breast cancer treatment, photon mini-GRID therapy (mini-GRT) with beam widths of 1-2 mm has shown remarkable normal tissue sparing in dosimetric studies. ** Compared to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plans, mini-GRT reduced mean dose to lungs, heart, chest wall, and lymph nodes by 50- 100%, while maintaining similar tumor integral doses.[3]

The mean dose to skin—the most challenging organ at risk—was reduced by 20-60% in most cases. **Mini-GRT also yielded sharper lateral penumbras in skin and lungs (size reduced by at least 50%)** , demonstrating potential for preoperative treatment with high skin and normal tissue-sparing capabilities.[3]

## Immunological Mechanisms of SFRT

**SFRT potentiates immune-mediated tumor control by creating protective reservoirs of the tumor immune microenvironment. ** Agent-based modeling suggests that radiation-induced cancer cell death alone is insufficient for tumor clearance with whole tumor radiotherapy, but explicit consideration of radiation-induced anti-tumor immunity synergizes with radiation cytotoxicity to eradicate tumors. **For some pre-treatment tumor immune microenvironment compositions, SFRT-GRID may be superior to whole tumor radiotherapy in providing tumor control** .[4]

While there is agreement that SFRT modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, it remains unclear whether the anti-tumor immunity generated is more beneficial than that resulting from conventional radiotherapy.[5]

SFRT provokes release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activates innate immune pathways, potentially leading to immunogenic cell death and reshaping the tumor microenvironment.[6]

## Pulsed Reduced Dose-Rate Radiotherapy (PRDR)

**PRDR delivers the daily radiation dose of 2 Gy in 10 sub-fractions (pulses) with 3-minute intervals, creating an effective low dose rate of 0.067 Gy/min. ** This technique exploits the hyper-radiosensitivity of tumor cells at small doses and reduced normal tissue toxicity at low dose rates.[7] **In breast cancer specifically, PRDR has shown promise for reirradiation of locoregional recurrence in previously irradiated regions. ** A study of 17 patients with locoregional recurrent breast cancer reirradiated to the chest wall, axilla, or supraclavicular region using PRDR achieved a **2-year local control rate of 92%** .[8]

The median prior radiation dose was 60 Gy, and a median PRDR dose of 54 Gy (range 40-66 Gy) was delivered. Despite a median cumulative dose of 110 Gy (range 80-236 Gy), there was only one grade 3 and one grade 4 late toxicity.[8]

Treatment was well tolerated with only 4 patients experiencing grade 3 acute skin toxicity. Eight patients received concomitant low-dose capecitabine for radiosensitization.[8]

These results suggest PRDR is an effective method to reirradiate large volumes of previously irradiated tissue in selected patients with locoregional recurrences that have developed resistance to prior conventional radiotherapy.

## FLASH Radiotherapy

**FLASH radiotherapy delivers ultra-high dose rates (typically >40 Gy/s) and has demonstrated remarkable normal tissue sparing while maintaining tumor control in preclinical models. ** However, its application in breast cancer shows site-specific considerations. **Treatment planning studies suggest FLASH-RT may be particularly beneficial for breast cancer. ** Analysis of five breast cancer patients showed **positive netsparing for organs at risk, indicating that the FLASH effect outweighed increased toxicity from hypofractionation** .[9]

Even under conservative scenarios (higher tumor α/β versus normal tissue α/β), most OARs showed positive netsparing.[9]

This contrasts with glioblastoma and head- and-neck cases where no netsparing was observed. **FLASH-RT appears beneficial for tumor sites where tumor α/β ≲ normal tissue α/β, such as breast and prostate** .[9]

The mechanisms underlying FLASH effects include radiolytic oxygen depletion, radical recombination, immune modulation, mitochondrial dynamics, and preservation of DNA integrity.[10]

However, the differential sensitivity of healthy tissues versus tumors to FLASH radiotherapy remains incompletely explained.[11]

## Combining Novel Techniques

**The combination of FLASH-RT and SFRT could represent a synergistic alliance. ** Both techniques use non- standard dose delivery methods to reduce normal tissue toxicity and increase the therapeutic index, though likely based on different mechanisms.[12]

With therapeutic potential established separately for each technique, combining FLASH-RT and SFRT could be implemented in the near future.[12] **SFRT is more powerful in enhancing antitumor immunity than conventional fractionation radiotherapy and works better with immune checkpoint inhibitors** .[13]

This suggests potential for triple combinations of SFRT, immunotherapy, and systemic agents to overcome resistance in breast cancer.

## Clinical Implementation and Challenges

**SFRT can be clinically implemented through existing intensity-modulated radiotherapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy, image-guided technologies, and low-cost GRID collimators** .[14]

Despite pilot clinical results, multi- institutional trials and prospective standardized treatment regimens are still needed to evaluate the SFRT pilot experience.[14]

For FLASH-RT, major challenges persist in optimizing radiation delivery protocols, unraveling precise biological mechanisms, and translating findings into clinical practice.[10]

The influence of key technical parameters including radiation modality, total dose, dose rate, and fractionation schemes, alongside biological determinants such as tissue radiosensitivity and tumor heterogeneity, requires systematic analysis.[10]

Would you like me to summarize the latest preclinical evidence on the specific molecular pathways and resistance mechanisms that are uniquely targeted by these non-traditional radiotherapy techniques in breast cancer, particularly focusing on how they differ from conventional radiotherapy's effects on DNA repair, hypoxia, and immune modulation? Would you like me to review and summarize the current clinical trial landscape—including ongoing and completed studies—evaluating SFRT, PRDR, and FLASH radiotherapy in breast cancer, with a focus on reported outcomes related to overcoming treatment resistance and safety profiles? This could help clarify how these promising techniques are translating from preclinical models to real-world patient care.
