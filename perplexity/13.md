# Does radiotherapy alter gene expression levels for patients who receive chemotherapy, and vice versa?

Yes. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy induce characteristic DNA damage–response and stress–response programs, and many of the same pathways are modulated when either modality is given alone or together. These therapy‑induced transcriptional changes can, in turn, alter sensitivity or resistance to the *other* modality, although the effect is highly context‑ and schedule‑dependent.[^1][^2][^3]

## How radiotherapy changes gene expression

Ionizing radiation produces a relatively stereotyped transcriptional response in breast and other cells:

- Radiation‑responsive signatures include:
    - Upregulation of DNA damage response and checkpoint genes (e.g., *GADD45A*, *XPC*, *PPM1D*, *FAS*), cell‑cycle arrest factors, and apoptotic mediators.[^2][^1]
    - Downregulation of proliferation and mitosis‑related transcripts, consistent with checkpoint activation and reduced cycling after irradiation.[^1]
- These “radiation‑induced” and “radiation‑repressed” gene sets are detectable in untreated tumors and stratify prognosis and radioresponsiveness, implying that tumors with a constitutively “radiation‑like” expression pattern behave as if the DDR pathway is already activated.[^2][^1]

In breast cancer cohorts treated with postoperative radiotherapy, specific radiation‑related expression modules and small multi‑gene signatures (e.g., an 11‑gene radiotherapy–response signature) distinguish radio‑sensitive from radio‑resistant tumors, and many of the signature genes are immune or inflammatory regulators. This indicates that radiation exposure not only alters intrinsic DDR genes but also reshapes tumor–immune interactions in ways that influence response to subsequent systemic treatments.[^3][^2]

## Chemotherapy’s impact on radiation‑related pathways

DNA‑damaging chemotherapies (anthracyclines, platinum agents) activate much of the same DDR and interferon/inflammatory circuitry that radiation does:

- An interferon‑related DNA damage resistance signature was initially derived from radiation‑resistant cells but also predicts resistance to DNA‑damaging chemotherapy in women with breast cancer.[^2]
- Across tumor types, genes induced after radiation overlap strongly with those induced by genotoxic chemotherapy and show p53‑dependent patterns, suggesting a conserved transcriptional program of genotoxic stress that does not “care” whether the damage came from radiation or chemotherapy.[^2]

Practically, this means prior chemotherapy can “pre‑condition” tumors and normal tissues by inducing sustained DDR, interferon, and immune‑modulatory gene expression, which may either sensitize or adapt cells to later radiotherapy depending on timing and repair capacity. Conversely, prior radiotherapy can create a tumor that already expresses genes associated with chemotherapy resistance (e.g., DDR and interferon‑related resistance signatures), again in a time‑ and dose‑dependent fashion.[^1][^2]

## Bidirectional cross‑talk in combined or sequential therapy

When radiotherapy and chemotherapy are combined (concurrently or sequentially), the overlapping transcriptional programs can interact in several ways:

- **Potential sensitization**
    - Transient upregulation of pro‑apoptotic genes and checkpoint activation by either modality can increase cell kill when the second modality is delivered during this window, which underlies many radiosensitizing chemotherapy regimens.[^1][^2]
- **Potential cross‑resistance**
    - Stable or chronic induction of DNA repair, cell‑cycle checkpoints, and interferon‑related resistance programs can make tumor cells more adept at surviving subsequent genotoxic stress from the other modality.[^6][^2]

In short, radiotherapy and chemotherapy each generate gene‑expression changes that can significantly influence how a tumor responds to the other, but the direction of the effect (sensitization vs resistance) depends on treatment sequence, interval, dose, tumor subtype, and baseline DDR/immune status.[^3][^1][^2]
